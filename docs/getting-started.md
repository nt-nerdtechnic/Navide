# Getting Started

[English](getting-started.md) | [繁體中文](zh-TW/getting-started.md)

Navide currently supports macOS 13 or newer and is installed from source. A signed downloadable release is planned but is not yet published.

## What you need

- macOS 13+
- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 10+
- Python 3.12+
- uv 0.11+
- At least one supported coding CLI:
  - Claude Code (`claude`)
  - Codex (`codex`)
  - Antigravity CLI (`agy`)
  - Grok CLI (`grok`)
- Optional: Ollama or a local GGUF model for local analysis

Each coding CLI has its own installation, authentication, subscription, and data policy. Navide does not replace those requirements.

## Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nt-nerdtechnic/Navide.git
cd Navide
pnpm install
uv --project backend sync
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` starts the Electron application, Vite renderer, and Python FastAPI backend together.

## First launch

The onboarding wizard checks the required runtimes and detects available agent CLIs. Complete these steps:

1. Resolve any blocked foundation dependency.
2. Confirm that at least one coding CLI is available and authenticated.
3. Configure a local analyzer if you want intent detection and automatic answers.
4. Grant only the macOS permissions needed by the workflows you use.
5. Open a trusted project folder as the workspace.

Navide may request Automation, Files and Folders, or Full Disk Access depending on how agents and terminals interact with the workspace. Review the reason shown by macOS before granting a permission.

## Run a first task

For the smallest successful test:

1. Open a disposable or version-controlled workspace.
2. Spawn one agent manually.
3. Give it a read-only task such as “summarize this repository.”
4. Confirm that terminal output, session detection, and History update.
5. Review Token Stats if the CLI exposes compatible usage logs.

After the manual flow works, try a pipeline with a small task. Review stage definitions and disable YOLO or Full Auto until you understand their effects.

## Development checks

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test:run
uv --project backend run pytest backend/tests
```

See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) if the app, backend, CLI, session binding, analyzer, or token tracking does not start as expected.
