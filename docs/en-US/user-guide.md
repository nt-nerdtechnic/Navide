## Product model

Navide is designed for one engineer directing multiple AI agents. The primary interaction is not always editing a file; it is setting an outcome, coordinating sessions, observing progress, handling meaningful exceptions, and accepting verified results.

Daily work moves through three loops:

1. **Genesis** uses a pipeline to turn an idea into a first working prototype.
2. **Evolution** repeatedly develops, tests, fixes, and refines an existing project through one or more agent sessions.
3. **Intervention** lets the engineer inspect or directly change the result through Diff, editor, terminal, diagnostics, Git, and review tools.

The current Pipeline implements the Genesis loop. Manual panes and maintenance mode provide the early Evolution workflow. The editor and review surfaces provide Intervention.

## Runtime mental model

Navide has three levels of work:

1. A **workspace** is the project folder and the boundary for project state, run history, and Git operations.
2. A **pane** is a live terminal session running an agent CLI or a plain shell.
3. A **pipeline** is an ordered set of configurable stages. Each stage contains one or more parallel slots, and each slot chooses an agent and role.

## Workspaces

The welcome screen lists recent workspaces, supports pinning, and marks missing folders. Opening a workspace restores its UI state and eligible sessions. Before switching or closing a workspace, finish or abort active work that must not be interrupted.

Navide stores private, per-user project intelligence under `.agent-team/` inside the workspace. This directory is excluded from Git and must not be treated as shared team state. It can contain task context, session metadata, run history, handoffs, and token information that belong to the individual engineer's local workflow.

Source code and explicitly shared documentation remain the repository's team-visible truth. If information from `.agent-team/` must be shared, turn it into an intentional artifact such as a specification, architecture decision, test report, issue, commit, or pull request.

## Manual agent panes

Use manual spawn for exploration, maintenance, or an Evolution task that does not need a full Genesis pipeline.

- Choose an agent and role.
- Review the launch command before spawning.
- Use a plain Terminal pane when no agent is needed.
- Minimize a pane to keep its PTY alive without occupying the main layout.
- Rebuild or resume only after Navide has detected a reusable session ID.

Supported built-in agent keys cover 13 coding CLIs: Aider, Antigravity CLI, Claude Code, Codex, Copilot CLI, Cursor CLI, Grok CLI, Kilo Code, Kimi Code, Muse Code, OpenCode, Pi, Qwen Code. The exact CLI behavior and provider billing remain controlled by each external tool.

For Kimi Code panes, Navide gives the CLI a 100 ms escape-sequence reassembly window so arrow-key navigation remains reliable through the embedded terminal. An existing `PI_TUI_ESC_TIMEOUT` environment value still takes precedence.

## Pipelines

The included pipeline covers requirements, planning, design, implementation, security review, and testing. Stages, slots, roles, kickoff prompts, questions, and completion sentinels are configurable in Settings.

A stage can run multiple slots in parallel. Navide advances based on configured completion signals and agent state. Always review generated changes and test results; automated completion indicates workflow progress, not correctness.

## Manager and worker coordination

One slot can act as the global manager. The manager receives cross-stage context, delegates work to workers, handles worker questions, and signals stage completion through Navide's routing protocol.

Use a manager when a task benefits from decomposition or parallel ownership. For small tasks, a single-agent stage is usually cheaper and easier to inspect.

## Automation modes

- **YOLO** passes CLI-specific flags that bypass approval or trust prompts where supported. Some CLIs may already execute tools without a confirmation gate.
- **Full Auto** lets the analyzer answer agent questions from available task context.
- **Strict** asks for confirmation at selected timeout or progression boundaries.
- **Continuous** keeps the pipeline moving according to its configured automation behavior.
- **Local Analyzer** enables local intent classification and related automation.

Start conservatively. YOLO and Full Auto can cause agents to modify files or execute commands without another user confirmation.

## Management by exception

Navide's long-term operating philosophy is to let agents continue through reversible, observable work and return attention to the engineer only when human judgment adds value. Current automation modes are early controls, not a complete policy engine.

Intervene when:

- Requirements have materially different valid interpretations
- Architecture or product choices have lasting consequences
- Sessions conflict over ownership, files, or technical direction
- Tests and stated acceptance criteria disagree
- Credentials, payments, deployment, publication, destructive operations, or external systems are involved
- The result requires subjective product or quality judgment

Routine exploration, reversible edits, local tests, diagnostics, and repairs should eventually proceed without approval noise while remaining visible and interruptible.

## History and token tracking

History is an append-only timeline for pipeline, stage, pane, question, analyzer, handoff, and warning events. Run history is stored under `.agent-team/runs/` and can be filtered or exported.

Token Stats parses compatible local CLI logs and attributes usage to workspaces, panes, stages, and runs. It is an observability feature, not a provider invoice. Provider-side usage and billing remain authoritative.

## Git and review

Navide includes a removable factory installation of the official Git package until Marketplace installation is available. Its active package version supplies both the embedded left view and the dedicated Git window. Removing Bundled Git in Extensions persists across restarts; use **Restore** there to install the factory copy again. A verified Marketplace version takes precedence when present. The view supports repository discovery, working-tree inspection, staging, commits, branches, remotes, issues, and related workflows; multi-repository workspaces can switch between discovered repositories. Discovery scans run without blocking the backend and return partial results after a bounded scan period on slow filesystems. Repository operations stay local to Navide's Host/backend boundary, and GitHub/GitLab issue detection uses the configured `gh` or `glab` CLI when available. If the selected v2 package cannot load, mount, or report ready, Navide labels and uses the retained legacy Git renderer for that process. Security, trust, or permission denials do not trigger fallback.

Review changes before committing, especially after automated or parallel runs. Navide does not make an agent-generated change safe merely because it appears in the Git panel.

## Editor and AI terminal

The editor uses Monaco and provides file editing, diagnostics, plan rendering, diffs, conflicts, and AI-assisted workflows. The right-side AI panel embeds a real coding-agent CLI terminal (the same agents as the main window) and injects editor context when it starts.

These tools are the Intervention surface of the wider engineering environment. Navide's goal is eventually to provide the complete professional workflow without requiring a traditional IDE as the user's primary environment.

## Settings and portability

Settings cover roles, pipelines, MCP servers, analyzer behavior, AI providers, appearance, keyboard shortcuts, and the separate **Execution Policy** tab. That tab shows the read-only Host default, lets you create or edit one global `full`, `allowlist`, or `denylist` user policy, and keeps first-level system namespaces separate from top-level shell executable names. Full mode requires an explicit high-risk confirmation. For an open workspace it also shows the untrusted repository recommendation and lets you explicitly choose the Host default, user policy, or an accepted repository policy. Corrupt global policy state has a separately confirmed rebuild that preserves workspace source selections; an unsafe or unavailable policy directory instead requires manual remediation. The Extensions view shows a package's Manifest Permissions and exact package-version Grant separately from the selected agent Execution Policy.

CLI Agents additionally manages the installed coding CLIs: version, install method, duplicate installations, the result of the CLI's own last update, and buttons that run that CLI's official update and diagnostic commands in a terminal. Resume on Open can restore one CLI, the first Grid page, or the active tab; the Grid-page choice follows the Grid preset even when the saved layout was not Grid. Navide surfaces and runs vendor commands; it never updates a CLI itself. Exported settings redact API keys and tokens. Review MCP commands and environment variables before enabling third-party servers.

`.agent-team/` is not currently a portability mechanism. Any future migration between machines should use an explicit local export/import flow with redaction and retention controls rather than Git synchronization.
