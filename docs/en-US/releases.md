# Versioning and In-App Releases

> **Current distribution status:** v0.2.3 is the current stable release. It ships a signed and notarized macOS arm64 DMG/ZIP, unsigned Windows x64 and Arm64 NSIS installers, and a Linux x64 AppImage and `.deb`, all built and published by GitHub Actions and mirrored to `dl.navide.dev`; the macOS, Windows and AppImage builds are eligible for the in-app updater. Linux arm64 is built only on a manual workflow dispatch and is not published yet. Every stable release from v0.1.50 onward goes through the signed workflow described below (v0.1.49 was a one-off manual unsigned preview published while the signing key was being set up; v0.1.26–v0.1.48 were unsigned previews).

Navide uses semantic versions (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) and Git tags prefixed with
`v`. `package.json` is the application version source of truth. The local build
script synchronizes these four files when a version changes:

- `package.json`
- `backend/pyproject.toml`
- `backend/agent_team_backend/__init__.py`
- `backend/uv.lock`

Run `pnpm release:check` at any time to verify that they still match. The
release workflow also checks that the pushed tag exactly matches the version.

## Update architecture

Packaged builds contain an `app-update.yml` generated from the `publish`
configuration in `package.json`. Five seconds after startup, the Electron main
process checks the stable releases in `nt-nerdtechnic/Navide`. The renderer can
also start a manual check from the refresh button in the left sidebar.

Installing an update is always explicit: a user chooses **Update**, watches
download progress, and then chooses **Restart**. Settings → Updates splits the
flow into three toggles — automatic checks (on by default), automatic download
of patch releases (on by default), and install-on-quit (off by default, because
installing restarts the app and every CLI pane with it). The main process owns
the updater state, so every open window sees the same result and a window
opened later receives the current snapshot.

GitHub Releases must contain all of these assets from the same build:

- macOS (signed and notarized): `Navide-<version>-arm64.dmg`,
  `Navide-<version>-arm64.zip`, their `.blockmap` files, and `latest-mac.yml`
- Windows x64 and Arm64 (not code-signed): `Navide-<version>-win-x64.exe`,
  `Navide-<version>-win-arm64.exe`, their `.blockmap` files, and a single
  `latest.yml` listing both
- Linux x64: `Navide-<version>-x86_64.AppImage`, `Navide-<version>-amd64.deb`,
  and `latest-linux.yml`

The ZIP and `latest-mac.yml` are required for the macOS updater, `latest.yml`
for the Windows updater, and `latest-linux.yml` for the AppImage updater (the
`.deb` updates through the package manager). Do not publish only the DMG. An
arm64 Linux build, when published, adds `latest-linux-arm64.yml`.

## Download mirror

Every asset above is also served from `https://dl.navide.dev/releases/<tag>/`,
with `releases/latest/` holding the newest release's files and manifests. The
release workflow's final job writes it and fails unless the mirrored bytes
match GitHub's. The updater reads the mirror's `releases/latest/` as its feed
and switches to GitHub only after a network failure on the mirror (a 404 or a
checksum failure is reported as before); the website likewise prefers the
mirror when a HEAD probe answers. `RELEASING.md` covers re-running the mirror job, verifying
it (`scripts/verify-release-mirror.sh`), and what a rollback must do to it.

## One-time GitHub setup

### Release authorization

Running `release.sh` locally is not a security boundary: anyone with a source
checkout can run or modify a local script. GitHub must enforce who can create
an official release:

1. Create a `production` Environment under **Settings → Environments**.
2. Add the release maintainers as required reviewers and enable prevention of
   self-review.
3. Restrict the Environment's deployment refs to tags matching `v*.*.*`.
4. Create an active tag ruleset under **Settings → Rules → Rulesets** for
   `v*.*.*`; restrict tag creation and put only the release-maintainer team in
   its bypass list.
5. Store the five signing/notarization secrets listed below. They are
   **currently repository secrets** on `nt-nerdtechnic/Navide` (readable by the
   `production` Environment job); moving them into the protected Environment and
   removing the repository copies is a recommended hardening step.

The release workflow declares the `production` Environment. A tag push starts
the workflow; if required reviewers are configured, the signing/publish job
waits for approval.

The workflow reads these secrets (matching `.github/workflows/release.yml`):

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CSC_LINK` | Base64-encoded Developer ID Application `.p12` (**legacy** format) |
| `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` | Password for that `.p12` |
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple ID used for notarization |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Developer Team ID (`Q5988V8U8D`) |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | App-specific password from account.apple.com |

The first two sign the app; the last three notarize it (`mac.notarize: true` in
`package.json`). The certificate, private key, password, and the exact commands
to (re)generate the `.p12` and (re)apply the secrets live **outside the repo**
in `~/navide-signing/` — see that folder's `README.md`, and run its
`./set-secrets.sh` to reset `CSC_LINK` / `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` (add `--dry-run` to
also trigger a signing test run). The `.p12` must use OpenSSL's `-legacy`
format or CI's `security import` fails with a misleading "MAC verification
failed … (wrong password?)".

Missing or invalid credentials fail the release at the **signature &
notarization verify step** (`codesign` / `spctl` / `stapler`) instead of
silently shipping an app that cannot update. Secrets are never required for
local development and must never be committed.

## Creating a release

1. Finish and verify the intended changes. Update `CHANGELOG.md`, and add the
   version's in-app announcement (with an optional guided tour) — see
   [Release announcements](release-announcements.md). `release.sh` warns when
   the version has none.
2. Commit every intended source change and confirm the repository is clean.
3. Run `./release.sh X.Y.Z` (or `pnpm release:prepare -- X.Y.Z`). The script
   validates that the requested version is newer, synchronizes all version
   files, runs the release gates, builds the unsigned local artifacts, and
   creates the release commit and annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag.
4. Review the result, then answer the script's publish prompt. If you defer the
   push, publish later with `git push origin main` followed by
   `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
5. Watch the **Release** Actions workflow. Its macOS job installs locked
   dependencies, verifies versions, runs frontend/backend tests, builds the
   backend, signs and notarizes Navide, validates every update asset, and only
   then creates the public GitHub Release; the Linux x64 and Windows x64 jobs
   run after it and add their installers and update manifests to that release.
6. Install the release DMG on a test Mac and the installers on a test Windows
   and Linux machine. Publish a newer patch release and use the in-app flow to
   verify check, download, restart, and the resulting app version.

For the first public release, also verify the documented clean-machine install path, onboarding flow, privacy statements, and supported-agent matrix. Add the actual release entry to `CHANGELOG.md` only after the GitHub Release and assets exist.

Never move an existing version tag or replace assets on an existing release.
Clients and caches may already trust its metadata. Fix a bad release with a new
patch version.

## Rollback and emergency response

GitHub's updater selects a version newer than the installed version, so
republishing an older release is not a rollback. If a release is broken:

1. Mark the bad GitHub Release as a pre-release or delete it to stop new update
   checks from selecting it.
2. Fix or revert the defect on `main`.
3. Publish a higher patch version through the normal signed workflow.
4. Users who already installed the bad version receive that higher patch;
   users unable to launch must reinstall from the new release's installer.

If signing credentials may be compromised, remove the Actions secrets, revoke
the certificate/API key with Apple, and do not publish again until replacement
credentials are configured.

## Local packaging

Run `./build.sh` (or `pnpm package:local`) for a fast local unsigned `.app`
without changing the version, creating a commit, or creating a tag. Add
`--install` to replace the local copy under `/Applications` after quitting the
running app. Local output is written to `dist-local/`.

`pnpm dist` creates the full unsigned DMG, ZIP, blockmaps, and updater metadata.
Those formats are part of the production contract. Unsigned preview releases
must remain prereleases, and their assets must never be represented as signed
or notarized. Formal stable versions
are prepared only with `./release.sh X.Y.Z`, and signed artifacts are produced
only by GitHub Actions after `production` Environment approval.
