# Keyboard Shortcuts Reference

This Mini-IDE's keybindings align with VS Code / Cursor conventions.
All rules are defined in `packages/plugin-ui/src/shared/keybindings/defaults.ts` and resolved
via `useKeybindings` (capture-phase), with support for chord keys (e.g. `⌘K ⌘K`)
and when-clause conditions.

> **macOS symbols:** `⌘` Cmd · `⌥` Option/Alt · `⌃` Ctrl · `⇧` Shift · `↩` Enter
>
> On Windows and Linux read `⌘` as **Ctrl** and `⌥` as **Alt**: the rules are written with the platform-primary `mod` modifier, which resolves to Cmd on macOS and Ctrl elsewhere.

Every binding below can be changed in **Settings → Shortcuts**; see
[Customizing shortcuts](#customizing-shortcuts) for the file format and the
rules the editor writes.

## Git Window

## Chord Key Reference (`⌘K …`)

`⌘K` is a chord prefix. In editor text focus, pressing `⌘K` enters chord mode (300 ms timeout); the next key completes the command.

## When-Clause Conditions

Keybindings can be gated by context conditions. These eight are the whole set —
every condition any rule tests, and every one any window publishes.

**Window identity.** No window ever sets two of these, which is what lets the
same key mean different things in different windows (`⌘⇧G` is `openGitWindow` in
the main window and `focusSourceControl` in the Mini IDE). Settings' conflict
detection relies on it: without knowing the two can never meet, almost every
shared key would report as broken.

| Condition | Set by | True in |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `paneStage` | main window | The workspace window with the CLI panes |
| `editorOpen` | Mini IDE | At least one editor tab is open — also how a rule says "the Mini IDE" |
| `gitWindow` | Git window | The standalone Git window |
| `planWindow` | Plan window | The standalone plan review window |

**Transient state.** Unlike the identities, these come and go while a window
stays open, so a rule that waits on one is not dead — it just waits.

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `editorTextFocus` | The editor text area has keyboard focus |
| `findOpen` | The find widget is currently open |
| `modalOpen` | A modal dialog is currently open |
| `terminalFocus` | A terminal has focus — ESC and friends belong to the PTY |

Conditions support `&&` (and), `||` (or), `!` (not); `!editorTextFocus` reads as
"the editor is there but the text area does not have focus". There are no
parentheses and no comparisons — `&&` simply binds tighter than `||`, and an
unknown identifier evaluates to `false`, so a typo silently disables the rule
rather than reporting anything. The Settings editor therefore shows `when`
read-only; to write a new condition, edit `keybindings.json` by hand.

---

## Customizing shortcuts

**Settings → Shortcuts** (also reachable with `⌘K ⌘S`) lists every command as
one row per (command, `when`) pair. Click a key cap to record a replacement, `+` to add a
second binding, `✕` to remove one, and `↺` to restore that row's defaults.
Overrides are written to `keybindings.json` in the Electron `userData`
directory and broadcast to every open window, so they apply without a restart.

### File format

The file is a flat array of the same `KeybindingRule` shape `defaults.ts` uses.
Later rules win over earlier ones, and user rules are appended after the
defaults:

```jsonc
[
  // cancel the shipped binding…
  { "key": "cmd+s", "command": "-editor.action.save", "when": "editorOpen && !terminalFocus" },
  // …and put the command somewhere else
  { "key": "cmd+alt+s", "command": "editor.action.save", "when": "editorOpen && !terminalFocus" }
]
```

A command prefixed with `-` is a **removal**: it cancels the rule that binds
that same key to that same command. Removal is deliberately narrow rather than
"blank the key", because several keys carry more than one command separated
only by their `when` clause — `⌘⇧G` is `focusSourceControl` in the Mini IDE and
`openGitWindow` in the main window, and unbinding one must not take the other
down with it. Removals are matched on the canonical form of the key, so
`shift+cmd+p` and `cmd+shift+p` refer to the same binding.

A malformed entry is skipped rather than discarding the whole file.

### Commands with no default key

The list is generated from a static command manifest (`COMMAND_IDS` in
`commandCatalog.ts`) joined with `defaults.ts`, not from `defaults.ts` alone —
about a quarter of the app's commands ship with no key, and those are exactly
the ones worth binding. They appear as `unassigned` and can be given a key like
any other row. `commandManifest.test.ts` scans the source and fails if the
manifest and the `registerCommand` calls drift apart.

### Import / export

**Export** writes the current overrides to a file you choose. **Import**
replaces them wholesale, after checking every entry: a rule whose key is
malformed, whose chord has three segments, or whose command this build does not
have is listed as rejected rather than dropped quietly.

### Protected shortcuts

`workbench.action.openSettings` and `workbench.action.openKeyboardShortcuts`
must keep at least one binding — removing the last one would hide the only
screen that could undo it. They can still be rebound freely; the editor shows a
lock instead of the remove button on the final key, and a hand-edit that would
strand them is ignored on load.

### What cannot be rebound here

Both of these are listed read-only at the bottom of the Shortcuts page, since
that page replaced the old reference:

- **Terminal keys** (`⇧↩`, `⌘←`, `⌥⌫`, …) are intercepted by `useTerminal` and
  turned into control sequences before the rule table is consulted.
- **Electron menu accelerators** (`⌥⌘I`, `⌘Q`, `⌃⌘F`, `⌘C`/`⌘V`/`⌘Z`/`⌘A`, …)
  fire in the main process ahead of the renderer. They also fire while the
  Settings recorder is capturing, so those combinations cannot be recorded as
  shortcuts. `⌘R`, `⇧⌘R` and `⌘W` are **not** on this list: their menu roles
  were dropped precisely so the rule table could have them.

---

## Implementation Architecture

```
KeybindingRule (defaults.ts)  +  user overrides (keybindings.json)
    ↓  merged, later rules win; '-command' rules cancel their target
    ↓  resolved by KeyResolver
useKeybindings — window.addEventListener('keydown', handler, { capture: true })
    ↓  match found → stopPropagation
executeCommand (useKeybindings.ts)
    ↓
registerCommand handlers
    ↓
EditorWindowApp → activeEditor() → EditorPane → EditorView
```

- **Capture phase** — interception happens before the event reaches any target element, allowing chords to override native browser/OS behaviour.
- **Command registry** — commands are decoupled from UI; the palette and keybindings share the same `registerCommand` registry.
- **No-op safety** — unregistered commands return `false` without calling `stopPropagation`, so native element behaviour falls through unaffected.
- **Per-window resolvers** — each renderer window builds its own `KeyResolver`, so a write to `keybindings.json` is broadcast from the main process (`keybindings:changed`) and re-applied everywhere.
- **Recording** — while the Settings recorder is reading raw keystrokes it calls `setKeyCaptureActive(true)`, which suspends the dispatcher; the dispatcher's listener is installed first and window capture-phase listeners run in registration order, so the recorder cannot outrank it any other way.
