# Changelog

All notable released changes to Navide will be documented in this file. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow Semantic Versioning where practical during the pre-1.0 period.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.55] — 2026-07-23 — signed release

### Added

- Inter-CLI messaging: panes address each other by name and exchange `---MSG---` protocol messages through an idle-gated, rate-limited queue, with a log/compose panel.
- Auto-derived pane names: an unnamed pane gets a heuristic title from its kickoff / first-turn text (a custom name always wins), persisted and broadcast to peer windows.
- Cross-window pane drop: drag a pane onto a terminal in another window to inject its context into that pane; drops route to the most-recently-focused overlapping window.
- Compact, click-to-expand Active Agents list with a status dot, a type·role sub-label, and a one-open-at-a-time accordion.
- Mini-IDE VS Code parity: filename-aware editor language detection, Toggle Word Wrap (Alt+Z), explorer drag-to-move, and tab rebinding that survives file renames/moves.
- Plans pane: search, stage filter, sort, and in-body to-do editing.
- Rebuild resumable CLI panes across all tabs from the sidebar.
- Configurable resume-spawn concurrency limit.

### Changed

- Focusing a pane that lives in another tab now switches to that tab.
- On macOS, Alt+letter keybindings match by physical key (so Option+letter shortcuts fire despite the special character the OS emits).

### Fixed

- Repaint alternate-buffer TUIs on drag-resize so the footer no longer stays garbled until the next output.

### Distribution note

- Signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple; published as a stable release eligible for the in-app updater.

## [0.1.54] — 2026-07-23 — signed release

### Added

- Star / favorite Agent History entries: a "starred only" filter, and starred entries are protected from bulk cleanup (an explicit single delete still removes them).
- Search Agent History by log content, not just metadata: a chunked, ANSI-stripped log searcher over IPC with a debounced query.
- Native application menu: Help, New Window, Open Recent, and About entries.

### Changed

- Capture Kimi resume session ids via a single-candidate fallback so a freshly spawned sibling pane stays bindable.
- Show the agent-type label alongside the optional role in pane headers.
- Settings: horizontally scrollable tab bar, scroll containers on several tab bodies, Roles-tab polish, and a dedicated Updates tab label.
- Throttle and extend the timeout for terminal creation.

### Fixed

- Harden log-content search across chunk boundaries: withhold incomplete ANSI escapes, flush the UTF-8 decoder at EOF (truncated multi-byte/CJK queries still match), and bound concurrent file opens to avoid EMFILE.
- Emit the Kimi turn-complete event once per turn and harden the notify path.
- Re-check the dead flag inside the WebSocket send lock to stop a disconnect flood.
- Ignore IME composition events during keydown in the rename flows.

### Distribution note

- Signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple; published as a stable release eligible for the in-app updater.

## [0.1.53] — 2026-07-23 — signed release

### Added

- Reconnect lost ("ghost") conversations: a restored pane whose saved session id has no transcript auto-reconnects to a unique provenance match, or surfaces a status-bar banner and a manual picker to reconnect to a previous conversation.
- Resume-on-open preference (always / never / ask) controlling whether opening a workspace resumes its previously spawned CLI panes, starts fresh, or asks each time.
- Loop auto-stop: the loop appends a done-instruction so the CLI prints a `<<LOOP_DONE>>` marker on its own line once the whole task is complete, and the app stops resending the resume prompt.

### Changed

- Assistant turn text is now carried only on turn completion (shared text-join helper and a larger both-ends activity-text cap), making turn-text judging more reliable.
- PlansPane: extract hard-coded strings to i18n, load legacy markdown plans in parallel, drop the background-refresh flicker, exclude archived plans from "delete all", and support keyboard activation on section headers.

### Fixed

- Attribution no longer guesses an ambiguous same-cwd session→pane claim; a hand-written `--session-id` is honored as an explicit, deterministic pin.

### Distribution note

- Signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple; published as a stable release eligible for the in-app updater.

## [0.1.52] — 2026-07-23 — signed release

### Changed

- Move the update controls (version, check for updates, auto-check/auto-download, release channel, and release notes) into their own **Updates** tab in Settings.
- The status-bar "close all" now acts on a single click with a confirmation dialog, replacing the double-click-to-arm gesture and its hint.

### Distribution note

- Signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple; published as a stable release eligible for the in-app updater.

## [0.1.51] — 2026-07-22 — signed release

### Added

- In-app update experience: full updater lifecycle and UX (check, download, restart, and release channel selection).
- Agent History: search filter plus history filtering and grouping.
- Spawn history tracking for panes.
- Plans: archive without deleting, approve directly from a draft, per-plan file path in the sidebar list, and section collapse in the editor.
- Store backup and forward-migration when the app version changes.
- Log-reader parsing, terminal cursor shortcuts, and keybinding/completion improvements.
- Dynamic latest-release badges in the READMEs.

### Fixed

- Keep the selected layout mode when only a single pane is visible.
- Propagate pane renames to peer windows and autofocus the rename input.
- Reap a killed child process on timeout; serialize git fetch per repository.

## [0.1.50] — 2026-07-21 — signed release

### Changed

- First **signed and notarized** stable release. Same feature set as the v0.1.49 preview, now built with a Developer ID certificate and Apple notarization and eligible for the in-app updater. Establishes the signed release pipeline.

## [0.1.49] — 2026-07-21 — unsigned preview

### Added

- Mini-IDE plugin system: a plugin architecture with an install / update / remove lifecycle, an Extensions view in Settings, and per-plugin verification and packaging. The whole surface is gated behind an opt-in flag (`AGENT_TEAM_MINI_IDE_PLUGIN`) and stays hidden until the main process confirms it is enabled.
- Plugin marketplace: a registry service, a publishing flow with a signing and trust model, and a discovery website to browse, search, and view plugin details.
- Kimi Code CLI integration: conversation-log reader and resume support.
- Git History window as a standalone view.
- Unified plan documents: a shared model for HTML and Markdown plans with in-place todo editing, stage snapshots with live refresh, a shared review toolbar, and Plans surfaced as a left-sidebar tab.
- Keybindings: Ctrl+1–5 to quick-select a CLI type, and Cmd+Shift+<n> to switch stage tabs.

### Changed

- Plans move to a left-sidebar tab with drill-down, replacing the pop-out window.
- Grid layout accepts custom column×row presets.
- Refreshed status-badge colors across components.

### Fixed

- Prevent stored XSS in the marketplace by serving plugin assets same-origin.
- Derive the Kimi resume session id from the directory name instead of the file stem, and validate the session exists during resume preflight.
- Stop focus/refit repaints from falsely showing a RUNNING pane badge.
- Plan QA hardening: preserve skipped/unknown todo fields, close panels on ESC, and fix blank todo-only plans.
- Externalize optional `ws` native dependencies (bufferutil, utf-8-validate) so the build does not break.

### Distribution note

- This release is an unsigned, non-notarized Apple silicon preview. It is published as a prerelease and is not part of the stable in-app update channel.

## [0.1.48] — 2026-07-20 — unsigned preview

### Added

- Interactive plan documents: agent-authored HTML plans with a todo sidebar, live stage and status updates, comment anchors, and one-click task dispatch from the plan into CLI panes.
- Manual pane sessions for capturing terminal work outside a spawned agent.
- Status bar indicator for lingering CLI processes, with scan and reap actions.

### Changed

- Reduce keystroke echo latency in terminals with an adaptive output-flush fast path and focus-priority scheduling.
- Resolve CLI commands through an interactive login shell so PATH entries written by installers (for example `~/.local/bin` or Homebrew) are visible when the app is launched from Finder or the Dock.
- Refresh PATH from the login shell before spawning so newly installed CLIs are found without restarting the app.
- Improve npm-based dependency install detection during onboarding.

### Fixed

- CLI agents failing to launch in packaged builds because the backend inherited the GUI's restricted PATH.
- Spawn probe now degrades to a warning on timeout or transient errors instead of blocking the launch.
- Reap breakaway PTY processes that escaped group termination, preventing lingering CLI processes from accumulating.
- Agent history log preview reading the wrong path; the real log path is now stored and older entries are matched by filename across day folders.
- De-duplicate pane restore to avoid concurrent restore races.

### Distribution note

- This release is an unsigned, non-notarized Apple silicon preview. It is published as a prerelease and is not part of the stable in-app update channel.

## [0.1.47] — 2026-07-17 — unsigned preview

### Added

### Changed

- Handle dead WebSocket sessions gracefully in the backend.
- Handle subprocess timeouts in the terminal service.
- Prevent default browser behavior for terminal cursor shortcuts.

## Development version history

The source tree reached package version `0.1.39` before the public release history was established. GitHub currently has no published Navide release, so versions in that range must not be represented as downloadable releases retroactively.

Future release entries should be added when a signed GitHub Release is published. Do not invent missing release notes from package-version bumps alone; reconstruct notable changes from commits and verification evidence as part of the first release preparation.
