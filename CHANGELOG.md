## Development version history

The source tree reached package version `0.1.39` before the public release history was established. GitHub currently has no published Navide release, so versions in that range must not be represented as downloadable releases retroactively.

Future release entries should be added when a signed GitHub Release is published. Do not invent missing release notes from package-version bumps alone; reconstruct notable changes from commits and verification evidence as part of the first release preparation.
