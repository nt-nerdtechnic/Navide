# Changelog

All notable released changes to Navide will be documented in this file. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow Semantic Versioning where practical during the pre-1.0 period.

## [Unreleased]

### Documentation

- Reposition Navide as a local-first multi-agent development control plane.
- Align supported agents with the current registry: Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity CLI, and Grok CLI.
- Replace fixed-stage claims with the configurable pipeline model and included workflow.
- Add documentation index, getting-started guide, user guide, architecture, privacy and data flows, troubleshooting, and a phased long-term roadmap.
- Correct repository clone commands, contribution checks, privacy claims, credential-storage statements, and release expectations.

## Development version history

The source tree reached package version `0.1.39` before the public release history was established. GitHub currently has no published Navide release, so versions in that range must not be represented as downloadable releases retroactively.

Future release entries should be added when a signed GitHub Release is published. Do not invent missing release notes from package-version bumps alone; reconstruct notable changes from commits and verification evidence as part of the first release preparation.
