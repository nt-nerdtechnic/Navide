/**
 * Minimise, maximise and close for platforms that do not draw their own.
 *
 * Every window in this app is created with `titleBarStyle: 'hidden'` so the
 * renderer can draw the bar itself. On macOS that is safe: the system still
 * paints the traffic lights over the window. On Windows and Linux it is not —
 * the window comes up genuinely frameless, and until this module existed there
 * was no minimise, no maximise and no close anywhere in the process. A window
 * that cannot be closed from inside the app is not a cosmetic problem, so
 * these handlers exist on every platform and the renderer decides whether to
 * draw buttons for them.
 *
 * The handlers act on the window that sent the message rather than on a
 * focused-window lookup: a click in a plugin's <webview> arrives from a guest
 * whose owning window is unambiguous, while "the focused window" is a race
 * against whatever the user did between the click and the IPC.

 * The app's own windows hide the title bar and draw a replacement, so on
 * Windows and Linux they render `WindowControls` into it. Plugin contribution
 * windows cannot: their content is a plugin bundle with no Host bridge, and
 * reaching across that boundary to share the component is exactly what
 * `gitComposition.test.ts` exists to prevent.
 *
 * So for those windows the honest answer off macOS is the system's own frame —
 * which is already how the Plans contribution window is created on every
 * platform. macOS keeps the hidden bar, because there the system still paints
 * the traffic lights over it and nothing is lost.
