 * home when the floating thumbnail fades. Chromium's
 * `webUtils.getPathForFile` reports that source path verbatim, so a path
 * pasted into a CLI pane points at a file that is gone by the time the agent
 * reads it. Terminal.app never shows this because AppKit materializes promised

 * a directory we own, and hand back that path instead. Paths outside temp are
