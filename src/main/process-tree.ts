/**
 * Signalling a spawned process and everything it spawned.
 *
 * The backend we spawn is not the backend. In a packaged build it is a
 * PyInstaller onefile bootloader that unpacks itself and forks the real Python
 * process; in dev it is `uv`, which forks python the same way. Under that real
 * process sit the PTY children, each in its own session (see terminals.py).
 *
 * SIGTERM is fine to send to the handle alone — the bootloader forwards it, and
 * the backend's shutdown sweep takes the PTY tree down. SIGKILL is not: it
 * cannot be caught, so nothing forwards it. Killing the handle leaves the real
 * backend running, still holding the port and the shared app-data state, with
 * its PTY children reparented to init. Every SIGKILL therefore has to name each
 * process itself, which is what this module is for.
