// The composer read that submitEvidence's queued verdict depends on, across
// the seam between the two files that produce it: serializeRenderedBuffer
// renders the screen, composerFromScreen picks the input box out of it. Neither
// side asserted the other — readScreenTail had no test at all — so an xterm
// change or a CLI that grows its footer could turn every mid-turn delivery into
// "never submitted" with the suite still green.
//
// The box is located by its FRAME, never by a row count. A fixed window was
// tried first and is wrong by construction: Claude Code's footer is a variable
// number of rows (accept-edits mode, model line, quota warning, update notice)
// and each one pushes the composer further out of a fixed window — which does
// not degrade safely. It reports "not submitted", injectText presses Enter
// three times, and the sender resends into a queue that already holds the
// message: the antigravity bug dc4b191e fixed, arriving from the other side.
