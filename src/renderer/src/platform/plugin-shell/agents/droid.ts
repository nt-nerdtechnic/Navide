  // meaning --reasoning-effort under `droid exec`. Passing effort through
  // would resume a session named after the level, so both are refused.
  // Droid has no boolean "skip every prompt" flag on its INTERACTIVE command:
  // `droid --help` (0.204.0) lists only `--auto <level>` with low|medium|high.
  // `--skip-permissions-unsafe` exists, but `droid exec --help` is the only
  // place that documents it, and the interactive binary silently ignores
  // unknown flags (verified: a deliberately bogus flag still starts the TUI),
  // so "it did not error" proves nothing here. `--auto high` is the documented
  // unattended level and is what YOLO mode appends.

  // excludeAltBuffer snapshot already captures its conversation.

  // turn_complete `detail`. "model_usage_exhausted" is exhaustion; its
  // neighbours (model_authentication_failed, model_request_rejected,
  // model_provider_unreachable, prompt_rejected) and the retry classes
  // (overloaded, rate_limited, timeout, network) are not and are left out.
  // The TUI strings are the same event as text.
