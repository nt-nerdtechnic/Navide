/**
 * Meta Muse Code — identity, spawn, permission bypass and resume.
 *
 * Meta's public documentation (https://dev.meta.ai/docs/muse-code/, checked
 * 2026-08-11) now covers permissions, interactive use and headless runs, so
 * the parts it pins down exactly are wired here: `muse resume <id>` is a
 * SUBCOMMAND (like codex's), and the approval layer has documented opt-out
 * flags.
 *
 * A log reader now exists (cli_vendors/muse.py, written against real session
 * files), so the two capabilities that depend on it are wired: the reader
 * binds a session to its pane through the `at-pane:` marker, which lands
 * verbatim in muse's command-intake record, and it discovers the session id
 * (the session DIRECTORY's name) that Rebuild needs.
 *
 * `turnEndInferredFromSilence` stays unset because it would be wrong: muse
 * writes an explicit `terminal` record and the reader emits turn_complete
 * only from it. `verifiedTurnText` also stays unset — the reader carries turn
 * text, which is enough for inter-CLI messaging, but per the types.ts note it
 * is deliberately withheld until the text has been validated against real
 * multi-turn sessions with a real provider (the samples this was built from
 * ran the `echo` provider). Paste protocol and login recovery stay unset:
 * neither is a reader question and neither has been observed.
