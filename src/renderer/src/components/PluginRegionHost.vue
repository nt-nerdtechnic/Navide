// An in-window plugin contribution, carried by an Electron <webview>.
//
// It used to be a native WebContentsView positioned from measured DOM bounds.
// That composites above the whole document, so a modal could never cover a
// plugin panel, and geometry had to be mirrored by hand (bounds, host resize,
// zoom factor). As a guest in this document the panel is laid out and stacked
// by CSS like anything else.
//
// Identity stays with the Host: prepareContribution returns only a URL holding
// a one-time token, and main overrides the guest's webPreferences on attach.
// Measured, not assumed: `display: none` keeps a guest's webContents alive and
// running — both when applied after attach and when the guest is created
// inside an already-hidden subtree — which is what lets a hidden Git tab keep
// its changes badge current.
