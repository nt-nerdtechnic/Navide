   The first attempt was a COLOURED stripe, meant to tell you which group you
   were in once its heading had scrolled away. Then the colour became the
   group's RUN STATE rather than its identity — the more useful signal, and the
   tab bar's own — and the stripe could no longer answer the question it
   existed for: two groups that are both running are both green. So it went.

   This one is deliberately NEUTRAL and answers a different question. "Which
   group am I in" is now answered by the heading, which sticks to the top of
   the scroller; all the rail says is "this group has not ended yet", and for
   that, one border-coloured line is enough. Giving it a colour again would
   walk straight back into the contradiction above. */
