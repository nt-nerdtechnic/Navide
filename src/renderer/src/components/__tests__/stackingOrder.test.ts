// Written after a pairing request — a security question that expires in five
// minutes — was drawn behind the account window and blurred by its backdrop.
// The prompt used `var(--z-toast)` (3000) exactly as intended; the account
// window used `z-index: 8000`, a number chosen at some point to beat whatever
// was on screen then, and 8000 wins.
//
// The test that was supposed to hold this compared `--z-toast` against
// `--z-modal` and found the tokens correctly ordered. Both facts were true and
// neither was in the fight: the window that covered the prompt never mentioned
// either token. So this one reads the numbers that are actually written down,
// which is the only place the browser looks.
//
// It is deliberately a scan and not a mount. What breaks this rule is a new
// component nobody thought to test, added months from now — the failure mode is
// "not covered", so the assertion has to be about the whole tree rather than
// about the components somebody remembered.

 * is invisible to every rule expressed in tokens.
 *
 * `.ts` and `.js` count, spelled `zIndex`, because that is where the rule was
 * being broken while this test was green: two `inset: 0` sheets in
 * useTerminal.ts assigned `zIndex: '99999'` to `element.style`, and reading
 * only stylesheets for only the hyphenated spelling meant this file promised
