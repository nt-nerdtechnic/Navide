// A switch reaches the two halves of "which workspace, whose groups" at
// different times: currentWorkspace changes in onWorkspaceBrowse, the entered
// workspace's groups arrive several awaits later in _loadRunGroups. The owner
// guard added after the 2026-08-27 wipe closed one exit from that window — a
// save keyed off currentWorkspace writing the LEAVING workspace's list into the
// ENTERED workspace's record. It left the other two open:
//
//   - the tab strip is a computed, so it recomputes inside the window from the
//     entered workspace's panes crossed with the left workspace's groups;
//   - a pane spawned inside the window takes its run_group_id from the LEFT
//     workspace's active tab, and that id is persisted into the entered
//     workspace's pane record — permanently.
//
// The second one is not a flicker. Reading the projects on disk, one id
// (rg-1789476153599, minted 2026-09-15 in Agent-Team as "Run 5") is now also
// IDA's "主要開發" and nt-official's "Run 2"; ids are `rg-${Date.now()}`, so two
// projects cannot mint the same one. ensureSavedGroup then rebuilds the foreign
// id as a group named `Run N` in the workspace it leaked into — the empty tabs
// the user reported.
//
// Source-scanned, like the other App.*.test.ts files: App.vue cannot be
// mounted, since backend and terminal lifecycles start on mount.
