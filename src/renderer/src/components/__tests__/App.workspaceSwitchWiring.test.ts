// Every fix in this feature introduced the next problem: scoping onKillAll to
// the workspace on screen aimed it at the one being left; calling
// onWorkspaceCheck immediately — to stop the window pairing a new workspace
// with old run groups — made ControlPane's debounced call abort the restore
// the first one had started. Neither was visible in the changed function; both
// were visible in how two of them ran together.
//
// Source-scanned, like the other App.*.test.ts files.
