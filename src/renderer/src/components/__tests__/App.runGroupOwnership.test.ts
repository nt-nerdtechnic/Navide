// runGroups is one ref for whichever workspace is on screen, and a switch
// reaches the two halves of that pairing at different times: currentWorkspace
// changes immediately, the entered workspace's groups arrive several awaits
// later. In between, a save keyed off currentWorkspace wrote the LEAVING
// workspace's list into the ENTERED workspace's record — [] whenever the
// leaving project never made a group, so a wipe rather than a no-op. Restore
// hits that window every time, since ensureSavedGroup saves once per restored
// pane.
//
// What it looked like afterwards: the panes kept their run_group_id, so they
// matched no tab, and buildStageTabs did not adopt them into the manual tab
// either — the whole strip stopped rendering and the panes were listed in the
// sidebar but reachable from nowhere. Two things answer that now: buildStageTabs
// surfaces a tab for an id no record matches, and adoptOrphanRunGroups puts the
// record back under that same id rather than clearing the pane.
