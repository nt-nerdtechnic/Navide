// Same approach as App.spawnAdvisories.test.ts: App.vue cannot be mounted
// here, so these tests parse the source text. Source text cannot show that a
// branch behaves — and it breaks on a rename while staying green over dead
// code — so it guards ONE thing only: that a step is routed to the module
// that owns it rather than re-decided here. Everything the kickoff actually
// decides now runs under test somewhere it can be driven:
//   - lib/__tests__/spawnKickoff.test.ts — runKickoffAttempts drives the whole
//     attempt loop (per-attempt evidence, the counter, the one-shot gate, the
//     composer guard, an abandoned pane), the per-attempt decision, and
//     reporting the verdict exactly once.
//   - lib/__tests__/injectEcho.test.ts — composerHoldsPayload, kickoffVerified,
//     echoEvidence, submitEvidence.
//   - platform/terminal/.../useTerminal.composerWindow.test.ts — the narrow
//     composer read those verdicts are computed from.
