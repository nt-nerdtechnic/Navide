// The "Legacy recovery" badge sits in `.part-top` next to the panel it labels.
// `.part-top` is a column flex container with a blanket rule written for
// ExplorerPane — `.pane-split .part-top > * { flex: 1 }` — which outranks the
// badge's own `flex: none` on specificity. When that happened the 17px badge
// was stretched down the whole column, and since it is `border-radius: 999px`
// it rendered as a giant empty pill while the panel below it lost half its
// height (its native view was then drawn halfway down the sidebar).
//
// 3b359090 added `flex: none` to the badge trying to prevent exactly this and
// it never took effect, so this is pinned as source: scoped <style> is stripped
// before mounting, and the markup is identical either way.
