                     already said what this side wanted. That reasoning assumes
                     there is another machine and another person at it. A relay
                     is what breaks the assumption: it can answer with its own
                     key and never forward the request, and this side would pin
                     it having compared nothing with nobody. The digits cannot
                     rescue it — a relay supplies half of what they are derived
                     from and receives the other half, so it knows them. Only a
                     person reading two screens is out of its reach.

               true, and it named the one audience for whom it is least true.
               Do not add it back in that form.

               Your own machines never reach the policy at all: a sender this
               device has paired with lands in RING_SELF, and RING_SELF skips
               the policy check outright (server_link `refused = ... trust_ring
               != RING_SELF and not pane_policy.is_allowed(...)`). A sender it
               has *not* paired with is refused earlier still, by
               `_authenticate_sender`, as NOT_PAIRED. Neither path reaches the
               state the card described.

               What the policy actually governs is devices belonging to *other
               people's* accounts. A card about an empty policy would have to
               say that, and would have to be worth interrupting somebody for.
               The backend still reports `policyEmpty`; it is a true fact with
               no honest use here yet. -->
