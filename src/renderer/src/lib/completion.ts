//   • turn_complete — the CLI reported its turn ended (Claude Stop hook = 100%,
//     or JSONL turn-end for Codex/Gemini), captured AFTER the watcher armed so
//     a stale signal from a prior stage/turn is never reused.
//
// These are pure so they can be unit-tested without the App.vue watcher.
