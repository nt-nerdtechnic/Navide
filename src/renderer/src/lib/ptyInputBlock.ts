/**
 * ptyInputBlock.ts
 *
 * What injectText (App.vue) does when the PTY will not take its bytes.
 *
 * The backend writes to the PTY without blocking. When the CLI on the other
 * end has stopped reading — a TUI wedged on its own output, a `sleep` in a
 * plain shell — the kernel's input queue (about 1KB on macOS) fills, the
 * write gets EAGAIN and the rest of the payload waits in the backend's own
 * buffer. The `terminal.input` ack reports how much is still waiting as
 * `pending`, and an episode that outlasts a short grace is announced as
 * `terminal.input_blocked` / `terminal.input_unblocked` for the session.
 *
 * The echo watch alone cannot tell this apart from "the bytes were dropped":
 * both look like no echo. But the two owe opposite responses — dropped bytes
 * are re-sent, queued bytes must NOT be, since every copy re-sent lands behind
 * the first and is read with it as one three-fold prompt the moment the CLI
 * resumes. So a send whose ack says `pending > 0`, or whose session has an
 * open episode, waits for the CLI to read before the echo clock even starts.
 *
 * Pure so it can be tested; App.vue owns the tracker instance and the PTY.
