 *  mid-phrase (same normalization as matchSessionLimit / matchLoginExpired).
 *
 *  The account's state outranks the buffer. A pane prints the limit sentence
 *  for reasons that are not the limit — replaying a past one, quoting it,
 *  writing about it (this feature was built in a pane that did all three) —
 *  and the badge it lights then stands for the whole window while the CLI
 *  answers normally right underneath it. So a reading that positively says
 *  quota remains vetoes the sentence. Only a positive one: an absent, stale
 *  or errored reading leaves the buffer as the only witness there is.
 *
 *  For some vendors that is the permanent state, and the boundary is not the
 *  one it looks like. It is not "has a quota command": cursor, kilo and pi all
 *  report usage, but in windows of kind cycle / on-demand / credits / period,
 *  and only session, weekly and monthly speak for the account (HEADLINE_KINDS).
 *  So for those three the reading never says anything either way and the
