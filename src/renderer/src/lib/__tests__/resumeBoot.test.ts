// `claude --resume` at 15:11:46.8Z. A resumed claude reloads its transcript in
// silence for 20-30s, so after the shell's own first bytes the badge read idle
// and the messaging gate let the message through: it was typed at 15:12:02Z,
// 13s before claude's SessionStart:resume hook ran (15:12:15Z). The resume
// repaint that followed wiped the composer, read as echo and submit "growth",
// and the message was reported delivered at 15:12:23Z. The session transcript
// never received it; the pane sat idle for four hours.
