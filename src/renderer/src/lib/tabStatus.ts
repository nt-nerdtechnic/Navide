 *  prompt while another runs is, for the person reading the bar, blocked.
 *
 *  Everything finer (error, disconnected, stopped) still lives in the pane
 *  badge and the agent overview; folding those in here would trade a glanceable
 *  signal for a legend nobody reads.
 *
 *  'starting' counts as active: it means the CLI is booting and about to move,
 *  so the seconds right after a spawn should not read as "nothing happening".
