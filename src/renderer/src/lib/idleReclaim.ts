 * Whether a CLI pane may have its process reclaimed for memory.

 * An idle CLI never gives back what it allocated — a claude process holds
 * 200-300MB of GPU slabs for as long as it lives, whether or not anyone is
 * talking to it. Reclaiming ends the process and leaves the pane as the same
 * click-to-resume placeholder a restart shows, so the cost is one resume and
 * the saving is the whole process.
 *
 * That trade is only acceptable while the user loses nothing they did not
 * choose to lose, which is what this file decides. It is a pure function over a
 * snapshot so every "no" is testable on its own: the reasons are the interesting
 * part, not the yes.
