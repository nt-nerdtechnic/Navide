// Gate logic for agent-initiated pane spawns (SPAWN blocks). Pure functions —
// App.vue supplies the runtime context; unit tests inject fakes. Failure
// reasons and advisories are agent-facing text (delivered back to the
// requesting pane), so they follow the protocol language in data/stages.ts.
//
// This gate only rejects on correctness (unknown agent, bad/taken name, empty
// task, a model/effort the vendor cannot be told) — it never rejects on volume. Child/workspace/depth counts above the
// advisory thresholds below still succeed; the caller just gets an
// `advisories` note back to relay or log.
