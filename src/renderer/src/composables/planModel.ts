/**
 * planModel.ts
 *
 * Unified in-memory plan model shared by both plan formats:
 *   - HTML plans (`.agent-team/plans/*.html`, parsed by usePlanHtml.ts)
 *   - Markdown plans (`.plan.md`, parsed by usePlanFile.ts)
 *
 * This is the blueprint the format adapters converge on. It is a pure type
 * module (plus the two literal string tuples) — no parsing or I/O lives here.
 * The `format` field is a memory-only discriminator injected by whichever
 * adapter produced the meta; it is never persisted to disk.
