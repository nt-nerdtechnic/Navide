"""What a controlled navide-server can and cannot make this machine do.

Every test here plays the relay, not a peer. The relay is the one party that is
both on the network path and in possession of every device's public keys, and
the audit that prompted these fixes found that two things it says were being
believed outright: who a message came from (C1) and what this device's own
authorization policy is (C2). Both chains are reproduced below before they are
refused, so a change that quietly re-opens either one fails here rather than
being noticed the next time somebody reads the delivery path.

The fake server in ``test_server_link`` is a *cooperative* one — it answers the
way the real one does. These build hostile ones on top of it.
