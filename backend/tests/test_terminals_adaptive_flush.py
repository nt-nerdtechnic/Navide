"""Tests for the adaptive output-flush fast path.

Keystroke echo used to wait the full 50ms batch window before reaching the
renderer, making typing feel laggy (worst for IME input, where the wait lands
on the commit). Low-rate output now flushes after a 2ms coalescing window —
long enough to reassemble a repaint that macOS split into 1 KB reads, far
short of a display frame; sustained streams still fall back to 50ms batching
so the Electron flood protection holds.
