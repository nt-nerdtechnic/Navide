"""End-to-end check that text written via TerminalService actually reaches the
spawned CLI process's stdin — i.e. "文字送出後 CLI 真的有收到".

Unlike test_terminals_write_eagain.py (which stands a plain os.pipe() in for the
PTY master), this spins up a REAL child process through a REAL pty and proves the
full backend half of the pipeline: write() → _flush_input() → os.write(master) →
pty → child stdin → child reacts. If this passes, a "sent but not received" bug
lives in the frontend / TUI handshake, not in TerminalService.
