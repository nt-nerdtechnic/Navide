"""Waiting was one-way: the pane being waited on could not tell.

cli_wait_idle (and cli_send_and_wait, which is built on it) parks a caller on
another pane's turn and left no trace anywhere. So the pane being waited on had
no way to learn that somebody was sitting on a two-minute budget — and an agent
that judges it has another twenty minutes of digging in it makes that judgement
very differently once it knows. A waits, times out, B keeps digging: two wrong
decisions from one missing fact.

These cover the registry that closes it, what cli_whoami does with it, and the
three ways a wait can end without unwinding — timeout, cancellation, exception
— because a registry that leaks is worse than none: it reports waiters who
stopped waiting long ago.
