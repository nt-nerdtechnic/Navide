"""Per-vendor graceful shutdown: SIGTERM before the shared force logic.

claude clears ~/.claude.json's fullscreenBootPending entry from a SIGTERM
handler. A SIGKILL skips it, the next start counts a strike, and two strikes
disable its fullscreen TUI (the dim header row of previous prompts). So the
claude VendorSpec declares a ShutdownSpec and its kill leads with SIGTERM.

The regression this file mainly guards is the other direction: a vendor that
declares nothing must take the path that has always run, byte for byte.
