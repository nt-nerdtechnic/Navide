"""Regression tests for TerminalService input writes under back-pressure.

The PTY master fd is non-blocking, so a full kernel buffer raises EAGAIN. The
old write() dropped the chunk on EAGAIN — silent data loss that left the agent's
input box empty while the caller logged "✓ sent". These tests pin the fix: bytes
are buffered and drained via add_writer, never dropped, and stay in order.

A plain os.pipe() stands in for the PTY master: it is also non-blocking and
raises EAGAIN when full, without the line-discipline rewriting that a real pty
would apply to the bytes we assert on.
