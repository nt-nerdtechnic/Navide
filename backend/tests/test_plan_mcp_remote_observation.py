"""cli_get_status / cli_wait_idle / cli_send_and_wait against a pane on ANOTHER
machine.

The data was already here: every window uploads its panes' badge words to
Navide-Server, the directory lands in `remote_roster`, and cli_list_targets has
been handing `busy` / `offline` / `host_online` / `status` back for remote panes
all along. Only the three observing tools refused the address, one line before
anything was consulted.

What these tests are really pinning is the HONESTY of the remote answers. The
roster is one word per pane, debounced on its way here, with no turn_complete
and no `awaitingKind` behind it — so a remote "finished" is worth strictly less
than a local one, and the result has to say so rather than reusing the local
vocabulary. Hence: `source` is never "turn_complete" for a remote pane, an
"awaiting" timeout is named for the distinction that could not be made, and
"offline" is its own answer instead of a flavour of busy.
