"""force_redraw must deliver a SIGWINCH even when the size does not change.

Some of the CLI vendors we ship repaint on receiving SIGWINCH rather than on
observing a size delta, so this nudge is their only repaint path after a resize
settles. Measured against real PTYs on 2026-08-28 (six runs), bytes emitted in
response to force_redraw's exact ioctl pair at an unchanged size:

    copilot ~6000, aider ~400, codex ~96   — every run
    claude, opencode, droid, kimi, grok, cursor-agent — 0, every run
    kilo, qwen — indeterminate; see test_vendor_redraw_probe.py

Vendors that emit nothing compare the new winsize against the old one and skip
the repaint, which is what makes force_redraw look like dead code from a claude
pane. It is not: deleting it, or "simplifying" it to skip a resize to the size
the PTY already has, silently removes the post-resize repaint for the others.
No other test covers this — the frontend gates around requestResizeRedraw are
pinned by useTerminalResize.test.ts, but nothing checked that the backend end of
that path still signals anything.
