"""The delegation rule is one sentence, quoted in three places.

An agent decides between a Navide pane and its own subagent before it has
called anything, so the rule has to be where it reads: the server
instructions, cli_open_agent's description, and cli_whoami. Three hand-typed
copies drift into three slightly different rules; these tests pin each copy
to DELEGATION_RULE so a rewrite of one is a failure, not a divergence.
