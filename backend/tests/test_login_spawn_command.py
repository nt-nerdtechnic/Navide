"""Login panes jump straight into the CLI's sign-in flow.

The sign-in trigger is per-vendor knowledge read from `login_command_args`.
This module had no coverage while the table lived in app.py, so these tests
pin the behaviour the table used to encode — including the distinction that is
easy to lose in a move: `None` (no sign-in invocation, leave the command
alone) versus `""` (sign-in IS the bare binary, so strip the flags and append
nothing).
