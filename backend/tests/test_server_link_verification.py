"""Keeping "we sent you a link" from outliving the click that answered it.

The link learned whether an account's address was confirmed exactly once, in
``auth.hello``, and never read it again. Nothing on the server pushed it either.
So a person who clicked the link in their browser came back to a panel still
telling them to check their mail, and the only thing that moved it was
restarting the app — which is not a thing anybody thinks to try, because from
where they are sitting the click simply did not work.

Three paths close that, and they exist together because each covers the case the
others cannot: a push for the server that can send one, a poll for the server
that cannot, and a reconnect for the server too old to be asked at all.
