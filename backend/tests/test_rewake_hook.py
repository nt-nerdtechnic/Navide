"""Rewake delivery: POST /hooks/claude/rewake parking a background hook.

The Stop hook covers a message that arrives while a claude pane is working. A
pane sitting idle runs no hook at all, so instead one is left waiting here and
answered when there is something to say — Claude Code wakes the agent on the
hook's exit code and shows its stderr as a system reminder, with nothing typed
into the pane.

What is worth pinning down is the shape of that answer, that a waiter is never
answered twice, and that everything which cannot produce one returns promptly:
declining is what leaves the message to the ordinary typed path, while hanging
on would hold the channel open against a pane that no longer has it.
