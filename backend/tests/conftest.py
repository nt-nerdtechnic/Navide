# steps aside for whatever the environment already says, which is exactly the
# case where the promise matters. This is not hypothetical: on 2026-08-30 the
# server-link verification script had the same setdefault and wrote a
# cross-device trust marker into a real install, whose only symptom was that
# every cross-device message stopped, indistinguishable from someone having
# deleted the trust state on purpose.
