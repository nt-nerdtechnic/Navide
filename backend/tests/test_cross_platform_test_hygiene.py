"""Ratchets over the test tree itself: a test may not answer a platform
question the module under test asks a seam for.

`test_osplat.py` keeps three ratchets over `agent_team_backend/` — no scattered
`sys.platform` branches, secrets through `osplat.secret_files`, ported modules
POSIX-free. Those protect the product. This file points the same shape at
`backend/tests/`, because the day the Windows job joined the gate it caught
four tests in one afternoon that were correct code plus a POSIX-shaped test:
a `/bin/sh` handed straight to `subprocess`, a PATH split on `":"`, and a
`terminals.os.kill` stub on a module that kills through
`osplat.process_tree.kill`. The common shape is not "forward slashes" — a
blanket ban on POSIX literals would touch 66 test files to catch one bug — it
is a test constructing a platform-dependent value by a different route than
the code under test, so the two disagree on exactly one platform.

The `os.kill` case is the one worth the most: it did not go red on Windows,
it went *green*. The stub was never called (Windows kills through psutil), the
real kill raised an equivalent error, and the test passed while executing
none of what it claimed to test. CI is silent about that kind forever; only a
ratchet or a reader notices.

Each rule is a regex, an allowlist of today's offenders, and two tests: new
offenders fail with the seam to use named in the message, and an allowlist
entry that has become clean fails too — the ratchet only tightens. A third
test per rule pins the regex against a known-bad snippet so a broken pattern
cannot pass by matching nothing (the shape `test_osplat.py` calls
`test_the_seam_itself_still_makes_those_calls`).
