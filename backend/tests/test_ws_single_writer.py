"""Single-writer invariant: only Session.send_json may touch the raw websocket.

The websockets protocol forbids concurrent writes on one connection — two
coroutines hitting drain() together trip its waiter assertion and wedge the
socket permanently (see the pitfall comment on Session._send_lock in app.py).
Session.send_json serializes every outbound frame behind that lock, so it must
stay the ONLY call site of a raw websocket send method on that connection. This
test scans the backend source and fails if a raw send appears anywhere else;
new code must route through session.send_json() instead.

The backend also dials *out* to Navide-Server (server_link.py). That is a
different socket, but the same protocol hazard, so it follows the same rule:
one method behind one lock, listed below alongside Session.send_json.
