"""Regression: a pane's PTY child must own a controlling terminal.

`start_new_session=True` only calls setsid(), which leaves the child leading a
new session with NO controlling terminal. dup2'ing the pty slave onto fd 0/1/2
does not claim one — that takes an explicit TIOCSCTTY. Without it the kernel
never gives the tty a foreground process group, so it delivers neither SIGINT
(^C) nor SIGWINCH (resize), job control stays disabled, and /dev/tty is ENXIO.

That last one is what a user actually trips over: `sudo` insists on reading the
password from /dev/tty and refuses with "a terminal is required to read the
password", even though `tty` and `[ -t 0 ]` both report a healthy tty (they only
check isatty() on the fd, which was never the broken half).

Note the probes below exec a fresh interpreter. A shell would muddy the result:
on BSD/macOS a session leader acquires a ctty by merely open()ing a tty, and
bash re-opens its tty at startup (zsh does not), so a bash-hosted probe would
report a ctty that production never had.
