"""Stop-hook delivery: POST /hooks/claude answering with a queued message.

The endpoint's ordinary job is to report that a turn ended. For a claude pane
it now also gets to answer "don't stop, do this instead", which is the only
delivery path that never touches the pane's input box. What is worth pinning
down here is the shape of that answer, and every way it must decline to give
one — because declining is what falls back to the existing stdin path, and a
wrong answer stalls the agent instead.
