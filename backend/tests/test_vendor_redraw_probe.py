"""Which shipped CLI vendors actually repaint when force_redraw nudges them.

OPT-IN. Skipped unless AGENT_TEAM_VENDOR_PROBE=1, because it launches real CLI
binaries: each takes seconds to boot, some reach the network, and all of them
depend on whatever version happens to be installed. That makes it useless as a
gate and valuable as an audit — run it deliberately:

    AGENT_TEAM_VENDOR_PROBE=1 uv --project backend run pytest \
        backend/tests/test_vendor_redraw_probe.py -v -s

The regression line for the resize path is test_force_redraw_signal.py, which
pins the mechanism (a SIGWINCH is delivered at an unchanged size) without
launching anything. This file pins the fact that motivates keeping that
mechanism: some shipped vendors repaint on the signal alone, so removing it
would silently cost them their post-resize repaint. It is how you find out that
list has changed.

Baseline over six runs on 2026-08-28, bytes emitted in response to
force_redraw's ioctl pair at an unchanged size:

    copilot  6030 / 6036 / 6008 / 3010 / 6022 / 6018   responds every time
    codex     144 /   96 /   96 /   96 /   96 /   96   responds every time
    aider     442 /  221 /  442 /  515 /  736          responds every time
    kilo     8437 /    0 /    0 /    0 /    0          indeterminate
    qwen     4446 /    0 /    0 / 4673 /    0          indeterminate

    claude · opencode · droid · kimi · grok · cursor-agent — 0, every run

Only the first three are asserted. kilo and qwen emit continuously while their
startup animation runs, so whether bytes land in the measurement window depends
on where that animation happens to be — the non-zero readings above are that
output, not a reply. Asserting them would ship a coin flip. (The very first
measurement of this put kilo and qwen in the responding set for exactly that
reason: a fixed boot window instead of draining to quiet.)

A vendor dropping out of the responding set is not a bug in Navide, but it does
mean the "keep force_redraw" argument rests on a smaller set than it used to.
