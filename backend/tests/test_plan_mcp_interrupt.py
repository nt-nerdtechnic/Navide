"""cli_interrupt: asking another CLI pane to stop, without closing it.

The capability chain (per-vendor interrupt byte, the PTY write, onInterrupt in
the renderer) already existed; what was missing was the MCP entry point. These
guard the four things that make the entry point honest rather than merely
present: it reaches the window that owns the pane, it reports the state the
interrupt landed on instead of implying a stop, it never claims to have written
bytes it did not, and it does not blame a cross-device address for a limit that
belongs to the tool.
