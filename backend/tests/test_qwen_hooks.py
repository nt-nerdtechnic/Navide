"""Tests for the Qwen Code hook installer.

Qwen reuses Claude Code's settings.json hook schema, so the installer reuses
claude_hooks' merge machinery. These tests pin the two things that are Qwen's
own — the endpoint it posts to and the single event we install — plus the
non-negotiable property shared with Claude: the user's own hooks survive.
