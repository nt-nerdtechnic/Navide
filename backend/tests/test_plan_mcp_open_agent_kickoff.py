"""cli_open_agent blocks on the KICKOFF verdict, not just the spawn verdict.

The spawn verdict says the pane exists. The task is typed into it afterwards,
and that half was failing silently: the tool had already answered ok, the
caller took "ok" for "delivered", and six minutes later the pane was still
idle with an empty prompt. Now the window emits a second event —
agent_spawn.kickoff — once the injection settles, and the tool waits for it:
the answer carries `kickoff: "sent"` or `kickoff: "failed"` plus a hint to
resend with cli_send, and never a "pending".
