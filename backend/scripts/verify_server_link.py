"""End-to-end interface check: server_link.py against a *real* Navide-Server.

backend/tests/test_server_link.py runs against an in-process fake WebSocket we
wrote ourselves from the contract. A fake built from our reading of the contract
answers with our misreadings too, so it can only ever confirm that the code
agrees with itself. This script removes that circularity: it drives the real
``ServerLink`` — the same requests, the same reply parsing, the same push
handlers — against a running server, and checks what actually comes back.

Two links are opened for the *same member* on two different deviceIds, because
the server's identity model is a person and "one person, two machines" is the
case where a message can be echoed back to its own sender.

Sections 1-8 walk the happy path. Sections 9-14 are the boundaries a working
deployment actually meets: a message key that arrives twice, a policy that
refuses, a pane whose id changed under a cached hint, two devices discovering
each other's panes, a device that went offline, and the server itself going away
mid-session and coming back. Section 16 covers the account path itself:
registering, signing in, and what a freshly registered account can see.

Usage (server must already be running)::

    uv --project backend run python backend/scripts/verify_server_link.py

The script registers its own account on startup, so nothing has to exist first.

Environment:
    NAVIDE_WS            WebSocket URL (default ws://localhost:8787/ws)
    NAVIDE_MEMBER_TOKEN  reuse an existing account credential; unset = register one
    NAVIDE_SERVER_DIR    server checkout, used only by section 14 to run a
                         *disposable second instance* it may kill and restart
                         (default ~/Desktop/Navide-Server/server)
    NAVIDE_VERIFY_PORT   port for that disposable instance (default 8799)

Section 14 never touches the server under NAVIDE_WS: killing a shared instance
would take down whoever else is using it. It launches its own process, on its
own port, against its own throwaway database outside the server's repo.

It is deliberately *not* a pytest module: a test that needs a server running
somewhere else would fail the suite on every machine that does not have one.

Every run uses freshly generated deviceIds so repeated runs never inherit state
(a policy set by a previous run would hide "never configured" behaviour), and it
cleans up the session rows it created. It never writes to the server's repo.

One thing it cannot clean up: the accounts it registers (one in section 10, one
in section 16). The server has no delete-account call, so every run leaves a
``verify-*@example.com`` account behind. That is the server's data model, not an
unclean script.
