"""Install a GitHub Copilot CLI hook that reports when a pane is waiting.

Unlike Claude and Qwen, Copilot loads every ``*.json`` under its hooks
directory on its own, with no registration anywhere else. That lets us own a
single file end to end — ``$COPILOT_HOME/hooks/agent-team.json`` — instead of
merging into a document the user also edits, so there is nothing of theirs to
preserve, corrupt, or back up. The file is rewritten wholesale each startup.

Copilot's handler shape is FLAT (``{"command": ..., "timeoutSec": ...}``),
not Claude's nested ``{"hooks": [{"type": "command", ...}]}``. It accepts the
nested form through a compatibility layer, but the flat one is native.

We install ONE event: ``notification`` (lowercase — Copilot's event names are
not Claude's). It carries the same ``notification_type`` vocabulary the other
two vendors use, and ``permission_prompt`` there was measured to fire only
when a prompt actually blocks the turn. Its sibling ``permissionRequest`` hook
is deliberately NOT used: it also fires when a tool is auto-approved (verified
with --allow-all-tools), which would report a working pane as blocked.
