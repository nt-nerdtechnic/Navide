"""Filesystem watcher that keeps the "which account is active" ledger honest
when a CLI is signed in from outside Navide.

``cli_profiles_store.defaults[agentKey]`` is Navide's own bookkeeping: it only
ever moved when the user switched accounts through ``cli_profiles.set_default``.
Running ``claude /login`` (or ``codex login``, …) in a plain terminal rewrites
the live credentials behind the ledger's back, and every account row keeps
naming the old profile until the user notices.

Design (mirrors GitWatcher):

    CredentialWatcher.start()
        └─ observer (watchdog Observer)
            └─ one non-recursive handler per directory holding a live secret

The PARENT directory is watched, never the credential file itself: these files
are written with a tmp-file + ``os.replace``, so the inode a file watch is
bound to is thrown away on the first login. ``~/.claude.json`` is watched the
same way (from the home directory) because on macOS claude's secret lives in
the Keychain — that config file's ``oauthAccount`` block is the only on-disk
signal that the account changed.

That makes the event stream extremely noisy: ``~/.claude.json`` is Claude
Code's entire config, rewritten on every prompt. So a file event never
reconciles anything by itself — it only triggers an identity fingerprint read,
and the work below runs solely when the fingerprint differs from the last one
seen. Reconciliation never WRITES the live credentials: the live state already
belongs to whichever account the user signed into. Normally only the ledger
pointer is corrected; a login no profile holds at all also gets a profile of
its own, whose (empty by construction) slot is filled from the live snapshot.
