"""The account-wide key that makes synced records readable on every device.

Cross-device *messages* are sealed boxes: the sender needs only the
recipient's public key, nothing is stored, and the ephemeral half is thrown
away the moment the message is sealed. Synced *records* are the opposite
shape. They sit on the server until some device comes to read them — possibly
one that does not exist yet — so "seal it to the recipient" has no recipient
to name, and sealing one copy per device would leave a machine paired next
month unable to read anything written before it arrived.

So the records are encrypted with one symmetric key per account, and that key
is what travels by sealed box:

    account key (32 bytes, never leaves the Keychain in the clear)
        │
        ├─ AES-256-GCM ──→ every synced record body
        │
        └─ device_crypto.seal(recipient public key) ──→ handed to a new device
                                                        over the paired channel

Three decisions worth naming:

*The server never holds a key, and this module gives it no way to grow one.*
Only ciphertext is ever handed to ``server_link``; the plaintext boundary is
this file.

*A second key is refused, not merged.* Accepting an unrelated account key would
orphan everything already written under the first one — silently, because the
old ciphertext would simply stop opening. ``accept_wrapped`` raises instead,
and the caller surfaces it.

*Scope and item are bound into the ciphertext.* They go in as AEAD associated
data, so a record lifted from one item cannot be replayed as another. Same
reason the message layer binds the device ids.

**Rotation.** What is stored is not one key but a *ring*: every key this
account has ever used, the id of the one currently written with, and a
generation counter that goes up by one per rotation. Rotating mints a new
active key and keeps the old ones for reading, so a record written last month
still opens; every record written from then on names the key it is under, so
a device that lacks it says so instead of guessing. The ring is what travels
by sealed box, and a ring from a peer is adopted only when it is a *later
generation of the same lineage* — it shares at least one key with what is
held here. Two rings with nothing in common are the second-key case above,
and are still refused.

Rotation protects what is written after it. A record sealed under the old key
stays sealed under the old key until something re-writes it; ``needs_reseal``
and ``resealed`` are what a re-push uses to find and fix those.

The key id is derived from the key material (a truncated SHA-256), so two
devices holding the same key name it the same way without ever exchanging the
name, and the legacy single key — stored as bare base64 before rings existed —
gets an id the moment it is read, with no migration step to run.

**One ring per account, not per install.** The ring is stored under a
namespace derived from the server address and the member id the trust store
pinned for the credential, and nothing here answers until ``bind`` has named
one. Signing out therefore does not touch the ring — the next sign-in to the
same account binds the same namespace and reads the same keys — while
signing in to a *different* account binds a different one, finds nothing, and
can neither read the first account's records nor write under its key. The
ring the first version stored, unbound, is not attributed to whichever account
happens to sign in next: ``legacy_ring_pending`` says one is there,
``adopt_legacy_ring`` moves it under the bound namespace, and until one of
the callers with evidence does that, minting is refused rather than a fresh
key quietly orphaning what the old one wrote.

    Returns the active key afterwards.

    The whole of it — opening included — runs under the operation lock and
    against the account the caller names: an offer opened for one account
    must not land in the ring of whichever account is bound by the time the
    open finishes.

    Idempotent for the same ring — a peer re-sending it is ordinary. The rule
    for a ring that differs from the held one is lineage: it has to share at
    least one key with what is here, or it is a second account key, which is
    refused (adopting it would leave every record written under the first one
    permanently unreadable, and doing that quietly is worse than stopping).
    Within a lineage the *keys* of both rings are always kept — every key
    either side ever wrote with, so nothing written under any of them stops
    opening — and the later generation decides which one is active. An
    earlier generation therefore changes nothing but the key set. Two rings
    of the same generation that disagree about the active key were rotated
    apart while the devices could not talk, and that is refused: whichever
    this machine picked, the other device would go on writing under the other
    one. (Two rings that forked at *different* generations converge instead:
    the higher one is adopted with the other's keys kept, and when it comes
    back round to the other device it is the same generation and active as
    what that device now holds, so the union there fills in what it lacked.)
