"""Control-plane link to Navide-Server: this machine's pane roster, published.

The backend is the *client* here. It dials out to a Navide-Server the user
configured, authenticates with a long-lived access token, and reports the CLI
panes it knows about so agents on other devices can address them. Nothing
listens for inbound connections — ``/ws`` stays loopback only — so this file
adds no reachable surface beyond one outbound WebSocket.

**One link per backend process, not per workspace.** The backend is the only
process that sees every open workspace at once, and ``agent_messaging._PANES``
is already process-wide, so a single connection carries the roster of all of
them. A per-workspace connection would multiply the server's device rows for
one machine and break the "device" identity the whole addressing scheme rests
on.

Wire protocol (agreed with Navide-Server)::

    request   {id, type, payload}
    response  {id, type: "<type>.result", ok, payload|error}
    event     {type, payload}            server push, no id

**Transient and terminal failures take different paths, on purpose.** A dropped
socket is transient: reconnect with backoff, re-send ``auth.hello`` (the server
upserts on the same deviceId) and re-report the whole roster — the same shape
the renderer already uses when it re-runs ``agent_msg.register`` after a WS
reconnect. A rejected or revoked credential is terminal: the answer cannot
change by asking again, so the link stops for good and says why. Running a
revoked account through the reconnect backoff would knock on the server's door
every 30 seconds forever while the user sees nothing at all.

**Delivery reuses the on-machine path rather than duplicating it.** A message
relayed in from another device is broadcast as the same ``agent_msg.deliver``
event a local ``cli_send`` produces, so the receiving window's idle gate, rate
limit, queue cap and message log all apply unchanged; this module only adds the
receiver-side policy check the on-machine path does not need, and translates the
window's ``agent_msg.delivered`` verdict back into ``messages.ack``.

#: than trusting the nudges to be complete.
ROSTER_SWEEP_S = 30.0

ROSTER_DEBOUNCE_S = 0.5

#: How often to ask the server whether the account's email has been confirmed,

VERIFY_POLL_S = 30.0

#: The fallback vocabulary, used only when the owning window has not reported a

#: died was published as "waiting". The enum is wider now and the badge word is
#: passed through, which leaves these three as the answer to a smaller question:
#: what to say when all we know is the delivery flag. Mid-turn is "running",
#: anything else is "waiting", and a pane whose window has disconnected is
#: "disconnected" — transient, not
#: terminal. That distinction is the remote half of the local target-offline
#: code: the pane is still there and expected back once its window reconnects.
#: Reporting it as "waiting" would be indistinguishable from a healthy idle
#: pane, and "exited" would claim the session ended when it has not. A restore
#: placeholder is the second thing "disconnected" covers — see _pane_status.
STATUS_BUSY = "running"

#: Local-only, and deliberately outside the four values above: the contract's

#: roster entirely. It is substituted into this device's own rows in
#: ``network_snapshot`` and never sent anywhere. The wording matches the

#: must not be called two different things in two places.
STATUS_NOT_OPENED = "not-opened"

#: Bounds on the inbound-message bookkeeping below. Same shape as the MCP

#: caller falls back to the "unknown device" answer it gives when no server is
#: configured at all, which reads as "you typed the wrong machine" for what is
#: really "the link is down, try again in a moment".
#:
#: LINK_OFFLINE is transient (the reconnect loop is working on it);
#: LINK_UNAUTHORIZED is terminal (the credential was rejected or revoked, and
#: retrying can only produce the same answer until the user signs in again).
#: Answered when a message could not be sealed for a peer that has published a
#: key before. Deliberately a link-level code and not a server one: the message
#: never left this machine, and the caller must not read it as "the far end
#: refused" — nothing over there has heard of it.

#: The one word every unauthenticated inbound message is refused with. Kept
#: single on purpose, exactly as "policy-denied" covers both blocked and merely

REASON_UNAUTHENTICATED = "unauthenticated"

#: routes on the body's kind and never looks at these, but the wire needs them
#: filled and the relay is not ours to change.
PAIRING_WORKSPACE = "_navide"

        The chain this closes: the relay filled ``from`` and it filled the
        answer to ``auth.hello``, so it could write the same member id into both
        and the delivery path read the result as one of the user's own machines
        — which skips the pane policy outright. Encryption did not help, because
        a sealed box authenticates nobody: the recipient's public key is what
        seals it, and the relay is who hands that key out.

        So a message must carry a signature over
        ``(msgKey, fromDevice, toDevice, which body field, digest of it)``, and
        it is checked against the key this machine **pinned** for that device —
        not against the key the directory is advertising today. Once a device is
        pinned, changing what the directory says about it makes that device
        unreachable, which is the failure that can be seen, rather than
        impersonable, which is the one that cannot.

**A device with no pin is refused, not pinned.** This used to take a pin
        on first contact — trust on first use — which meant a relay that got in
        before the real device did was pinned in its place, and the only thing
