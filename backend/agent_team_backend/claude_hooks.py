"""Claude Code hook installer + payload normaliser.

Claude Code (CLI) supports hooks: `~/.claude/settings.json` may declare shell
commands to run at specific lifecycle events (PreToolUse / Stop / Notification
/ SubagentStop / etc.). Each hook receives a JSON payload on stdin.

We install four hooks pointing at our local FastAPI endpoint so the
orchestrator gets reliable signals (better than buffer-scanning):
  - PreToolUse    → 100% signal: agent is actively working
  - Stop          → 100% signal: turn ended
  - Notification  → user attention requested (e.g. waiting for approval)
  - SubagentStop  → a subagent (Task tool) finished

PreToolUse also carries a second, synchronous hook: Navide Guard's decision
(`_build_guard_command`), whose printed body can deny or ask for the call.

PreToolUse and SubagentStop together are what let the backend count the
background subagents a pane is waiting on: Task going in, its stop coming
back out. The unattended loop reads that count to tell "the turn ended
because the work is done" apart from "the turn ended to wait", which no
amount of buffer-scanning could distinguish.

The installer is MERGE-safe: it reads the existing settings.json, only adds
our hook entries (tagged with a sentinel comment), and never overwrites the
user's other settings. Removal cleans up only entries we added.

    Hard-caps the request + `|| true` so a slow/offline backend never blocks the

    The Stop hook keeps the response body, because that is where Claude Code
