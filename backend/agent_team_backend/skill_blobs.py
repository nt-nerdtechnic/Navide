"""Large skill files as blobs: sealed on this machine, stored in object storage.

A skill whose files do not fit in one sync record (the ``skills`` scope carries
only its settings then) has its files moved as blobs. A record in the
``skill-files`` scope lists them — path → blob id, size, key id — and that
record is sealed and synced like any other. This module is the blob half:
naming a file, uploading it, downloading it back. It does not decide which
skills take part; the scope adapter does.

Neither end ever holds a whole file. On the way up the file is read twice,
both times as a stream: once to name it (a keyed hash, ``sync_keyring.blob_hasher``),
once to seal it segment by segment straight into the upload. On the way down the
object is read as a stream, each segment opened as it arrives and written to a
staging file, and the name is recomputed at the end; only a file whose name
matches ever leaves staging.

The bytes never touch the Navide server. It hands out short-lived presigned
URLs (``blobs.presignPut`` / ``blobs.presignGet``) and object storage is spoken
to directly — which is also why a file of hundreds of megabytes is not bound
by the 1 MiB WebSocket frame. The layout below comes from ``blobs.caps``:

    segment = nonce ‖ AES-GCM(≤ segment_bytes of plaintext) ‖ tag
    part    = segments_per_part whole segments (S3 multipart; only the last is short)

so part ``n`` starts at plaintext offset ``(n-1) × segment_bytes × segments_per_part``,
and a resumed upload re-seals exactly the parts object storage does not hold.
HTTP is the standard library's: nothing here adds a dependency.
