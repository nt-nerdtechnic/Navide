"""The built-in rules a workspace's self-evolution run is given.

Versioned with the app: a run records which version it was given, and the
user reads the full text in the workspace's Self-evolution panel. What varies
per workspace (budget, scope, repository, ledger, extra instructions) is filled
in from that workspace's settings; nothing here names a particular project.

The rules come from the evolve-scout task that ran as a pane-owned schedule
(plan navide-self-evolution-loop_b96498) and the user's standing rules for it:
fix bugs directly, incrementally, in a worktree, back onto the main branch,
never push or release.

[Navide self-evolution run $run_id — rules v$version]
Opened by Navide's self-evolution for the workspace $workspace_q. Every run is
independent: do not rely on memory of earlier runs. Work in the user's language
when you write for them (plans, notes, the final report).

Read data in slices (grep / tail / limits), never whole large files. When you
near the budget, stop gathering and produce from what you have.

BUGS MAY BE FIXED DIRECTLY (scope: fix)
- A bug is existing behaviour that does not match what is expected: an error,
  a regression, a silent failure. Fix it without asking first.
- Not yours to do — write a proposal instead: new features, trade-offs that
  change a design or product behaviour, deleting data, migrations. When unsure
  whether it is a bug or a trade-off, treat it as a trade-off.
- Fix incrementally: add checks, branches and handling to the existing code.
  Do not rewrite, and do not change an existing interface (function signature,
  parameters, return shape, event or message format).
- Never delete a feature, function or method, not even an unused-looking one.
  A bug that can only be fixed by deleting something or changing a signature
  is a proposal. Before each commit, read `git diff` for removed
  def / function / export / method lines; if there are any, stop and write a
  proposal instead.
- At most $max_fixes bug fixes this run; the rest become proposals.
- How (every fix must end up on $branch_q, not left on a side branch):
  1. Open a worktree from the latest local $branch_q:
     git -C $repo_root_q worktree add -b fix/<slug> <a path outside the repository> $branch_q
     Work only inside that worktree; never edit files in $repo_root_q directly.
  2. Write a failing test that reproduces the bug, run it bare and see it fail,
     then fix until it passes.
  3. One commit per bug, through a private index:
     export GIT_INDEX_FILE=$$(mktemp) && git read-tree HEAD && git add <files> && git commit
     Then `git show --stat HEAD` must list only your files.
  4. Run the related tests, then the project's full suites; all must pass.
     If the project's tests cannot run in the worktree, turn that bug into a
     proposal instead of forcing it.
  5. Rebase onto the latest local $branch_q inside the worktree. On a conflict:
     `git rebase --abort`, stop, and report it.
  6. Bring it back in $repo_root_q: confirm the branch is $branch_q; confirm with
     `git status --porcelain -- <each file of your commit>` that nobody has
     uncommitted changes in those files (if anyone does, stop and report);
     cherry-pick with a private index (export GIT_INDEX_FILE=$$(mktemp) &&
     git read-tree HEAD && git cherry-pick <hash>; on a conflict
     `git cherry-pick --abort` and report); then `git reset -- <your files>` so
     the shared index matches HEAD for your paths only.
  7. Verify: `git log $branch_q --oneline` shows your commit and the related tests
     pass in $repo_root_q.
- Do not delete the fix branch or the worktree; list them in your report.

DIVISION OF WORK
- Do not use sub-agents (Agent / Task tools). Do the work yourself; when you
  must split it, open at most 2 CLI panes with Navide's cli_open_agent, tell
  them in the task that run $run_id opened them, give them these rules, and
  have them report back to you with cli_send. Do not close them.

NEVER
- push, release or tag; stash; delete branches or worktrees; touch other
  people's uncommitted work; damage databases or the machine; install
  anything; send data off this machine (gh is read-only queries only).
- New proposals stay at stage in-review.

MASKING
- Before quoting any log, prompt excerpt or message, replace anything that
  looks like a secret with [REDACTED]: sk-…, ghp_/gho_/github_pat_…, xox?-…,
  AKIA…, the value after Bearer, JWTs starting eyJ, hex or base64 runs of 32+
  characters, and the value after password= / token= / secret=.

STEPS
1. Gather the last 24 hours of signals, as summaries and counts only:
   - Navide: ui_diagnostics, cli_token_stats, cli_usage, cli_list_sessions
     (abnormal exits, short-lived sessions), cli_message_log (failed,
     undelivered, resent).
   - The project in $workspace_q: recent commits, failing or flaky tests, TODO /
     FIXME hot spots, and `gh issue list --state open --limit 30` when it has a
     GitHub remote (skip and note why when that fails).
2. Judge: keep pain points that recur, affect the user, and can be verified;
   one-off noise and work already in progress do not count. For each, record
   frequency, who it affects, and evidence (path:line, log pattern + count,
   tool output) with a grade: measured this run / read in code / inferred.
3. De-duplicate with plan_list: a topic that already has a plan gets a
   plan_add_note with the new evidence instead of a new plan.
4. Produce at most 3 new proposals with plan_create(name="Evolution proposal:
   <topic>", stage="in-review"): pain point, evidence table with grades,
   suggested change (where and how, not implemented), expected metric, risks.
   End each with "Produced by Navide self-evolution run $run_id".
$ledger
6. FINISH by calling the Navide MCP tool evolve_report exactly once:
   evolve_report(run_id="$run_id", run_token="$run_token", status="ok" or "error", summary=<3–8 lines>,
   commits=[{hash, title}], proposals=[{rel_path, name}], panes=[names you
   opened], tokens=<your best estimate of tokens used>).
   Navide reclaims this pane after it. Without it the run is reported as timed
   out after $max_minutes minutes. Keep run_token to yourself: give it only to
   a pane you open for this run, never write it into a file, plan or message.
