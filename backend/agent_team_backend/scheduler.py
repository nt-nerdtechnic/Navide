"""Navide's in-process scheduler: wakes a CLI pane with an instruction on time.

The scheduler only decides *when*. What happens at that moment is exactly one
existing path — the one ``cli_send(open_target=True)`` takes: resolve the pane,
open it first if it is a restore placeholder, hand the text to the owning
window and wait a bounded time for that window's delivery verdict. Nothing here
writes to a PTY, so the idle gate, echo verification, typing hold and per-pair
rate limit all apply to a scheduled message just as they do to an agent's.

Every job has an ``owner``. A change made in a Navide window acts as the user,
who may change any job; an agent (an MCP caller) may change only the jobs it
created. A job whose creating pane is gone belongs to nobody an agent can act
as, so only the user can change it — see :func:`may_change`.

Jobs an agent owns are also limited (the user's own jobs are not): at most
AGENT_ENABLED_PER_OWNER enabled per owner and AGENT_ENABLED_TOTAL enabled in
all, no interval under AGENT_MIN_EVERY_MS, AGENT_RUNS_PER_DAY_TOTAL runs a day
between them (an agent's run_now included), a periodic job disables itself
AGENT_EXPIRE_MS after it was last saved or enabled unless the user keeps it,
and a finished once job is deleted AGENT_ONCE_KEEP_MS after it ran.

It runs only while the backend runs. Slots missed while Navide was closed are
caught up at most once per job (``catch_up: "once"``) or dropped (``"skip"``).

A ``once`` job has a single slot. Its first scheduled run — ok, error or
skipped — disables it; the job and its state stay for inspection.

Loop structure follows usage_service: a ``_wake`` event plus
``wait_for(timeout=_next_sleep)``; the sleep is the distance to the nearest due
job, capped at 60s and floored at 2s. The clock and the sleep are injectable
(cli_risk style), so tests drive time instead of waiting for it.

Invariant (OpenClaw #13992 / #16156 / #17852): ``next_run_at`` moves forward
only when its slot actually ran or was judged skipped. Reads and re-saves never
advance an overdue value — otherwise a daily job silently becomes a 48-hour one.
