"""This device's signing identity, and what it puts its name to.

``device_crypto`` answers *confidentiality*: the relay cannot read a message it
has no key for. This module answers the other half — *authenticity* — and the
two are not the same question. A sealed box has no sender authentication by
construction: anybody holding the recipient's public key can produce a
ciphertext that opens correctly, and the recipient's public key is exactly what
the server stores and hands out. So encryption alone leaves the relay able to
*write* messages while unable to read them, and to sign them with whatever
sender identity it likes.

The fix is an Ed25519 keypair per device whose private half never leaves the
machine. Every cross-device message carries a signature over

    (msgKey, fromDeviceId, toDeviceId, which body field, SHA-256 of that body)

and the receiver verifies it against a key it has **pinned itself** before the
message is allowed anywhere near a trust decision. Three things fall out of
that tuple, and each is there for a reason:

*msgKey* stops a signature being lifted onto a different message.

*from/to device ids* stop the relay re-addressing a signed message to another
machine — the same binding the sealed box's associated data already makes, now
extended to the plaintext path, which had none.

*Which body field, and its hash.* Signing the bytes actually on the wire means
the signature is checkable before decryption, which matters because the
delivery path deliberately decrypts last. Naming the field as well as hashing
it means the relay cannot present a ciphertext as if it were plaintext and have
a wall of base64 typed into somebody's CLI under a valid signature.

The policy document is signed the same way, with its own context string, so a
signature over one can never be replayed as a signature over the other.

**What this does not do.** A signature proves a message came from the holder of
some private key; it says nothing about who that holder is. That question is
answered by pinning, which lives in ``trust_store`` — and pinning is
trust-on-first-use, so the first key seen for a device is believed. See the
note there for what that does and does not buy.
