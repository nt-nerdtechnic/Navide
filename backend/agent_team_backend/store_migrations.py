"""One-time, on-startup backup + forward-migration of persisted JSON stores.

When a NEW app version's backend starts for the first time we:

1. BACKUP the persisted app-data JSON stores into
   ``<app-data>/store-backups/<version>/`` (keeping the most recent 2 backup
   dirs), so a version upgrade can never silently corrupt a user's saved data.
2. MIGRATE each versioned store forward to the current schema via a registry
   keyed by ``schemaVersion``. At schema v1 the registry is empty, so this is a
   clean identity/no-op — the extension point exists for future bumps.
3. Record the current backend version in a marker file so the next same-version
   start is a fast no-op.

Everything here is best-effort: it is idempotent and must NEVER raise or block
backend startup. Errors are caught and logged. It never deletes user data
(only prunes its own older backup directories).
