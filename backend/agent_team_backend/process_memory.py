"""Real memory footprint of the CLI processes Navide runs.

`ps` RSS is the obvious source and the wrong one: it counts shared pages once
per process, which over-reports a fleet of same-binary CLIs by a wide margin
(measured at ~40% for a screenful of `claude` processes). macOS exposes the
number the kernel actually charges a process — `phys_footprint` — and that is
what a user comparing our figure against Activity Monitor will see.

That counter is read straight from the kernel through `proc_pid_rusage` (see
`proc_rusage`), which costs a syscall per pid and cannot time out. The
`footprint(1)` subprocess it replaced is kept as a fallback for the case where
the syscall cannot be resolved at all: correct, but superlinear in the pid
count, because footprint de-duplicates multiply-mapped regions across every
target it is handed. Measured here, twelve pids took 0.33s and a hundred and
fifty took 16.5s — which is how a busy machine ended up reporting no memory at
all, the sweep having hit its own timeout.
