"""Development-time tracker: heartbeats -> intervals -> per-workspace totals.

WakaTime-style model. Every ``terminal.input`` keystroke is a ``human``
heartbeat and every ``agent_active`` event an ``agent`` heartbeat, keyed by
(workspace, pane, source). Consecutive heartbeats of one key whose gap stays
within the source's threshold extend one open interval; a larger gap closes
it at its last heartbeat and opens a new one. ``turn_complete`` closes the
agent interval explicitly; pane removal closes both sources. Idle time is
simply the space between intervals, so nothing has to detect "idle began".

Intervals persist per workspace in ``<workspace>/.agent-team/navide.db``
(table ``dev_time_intervals``, shared with the other workspace stores). An
open interval's ``last_seen_at`` is written at most every BEAT_PERSIST_S;
the in-memory copy is always current. Rows still marked open when the
workspace is first touched in a process belong to a previous backend
lifetime and are closed at their persisted ``last_seen_at``.

All aggregation (union across panes and sources, human/agent overlap,
local-time day buckets with midnight splitting) happens at snapshot time —
interval volume is small.

Backfill (optional, once per workspace): the agent turns Claude Code wrote to
its transcripts before this feature existed are replayed through the same
gap engine and stored as ``source='backfill'`` rows under a synthetic
``backfill:<session_id>`` pane, so the lifetime total does not start at
zero. A kv marker makes it idempotent; ``reset()`` clears it.
