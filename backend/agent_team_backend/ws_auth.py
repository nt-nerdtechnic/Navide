"""Who may open the local ``/ws`` socket.

The endpoint binds to 127.0.0.1, which stops the network but not the browser:
a WebSocket handshake is **not** subject to the same-origin policy, so any page
the user happens to visit can open ``ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/ws``, scanning the
ephemeral range until something answers. Until now that socket accepted the
connection and went straight into its dispatch loop, and one of the messages it
dispatches is ``terminal.create`` with a caller-supplied ``command`` and
``env``. That is arbitrary code execution as the user, reachable from a web
page, with no cloud service involved at all.

The fix is a credential the browser cannot obtain. A page can guess the port —
there are only so many — but it cannot read a file, and that asymmetry is the
whole defence:

* the backend mints a fresh token per run and writes it 0600 beside the
  port file;
* Electron's main process reads it and folds it into the ``wsUrl`` it already
  hands to every window and to the plugin broker, so no client had to learn a
  new mechanism;
* a caller with no token, or the wrong one, is closed before any message is
  read.

Two smaller decisions worth writing down.

*The token is minted per run rather than persisted.* A token that outlived the
process would still be sitting in a file when the next one started, and every
client already re-reads the port after a restart — so there is nothing to gain
by keeping it and one more stale secret to lose.

*The Origin check is second, not first.* It refuses a handshake that carries a
web origin, which is what a hostile page would send; it deliberately does not
refuse a missing or ``file://`` origin, because that is what Electron's own
renderers send and guessing wrong there would look like "the backend will not
start". The token is what actually closes the hole. This only makes the hostile
case fail earlier and more legibly in the log.
