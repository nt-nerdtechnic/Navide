"""LLM-generated titles for CLI panes.

Talks to the same local Ollama endpoint the commit-message generator uses, so
this needs no API key and makes no outbound network call. It is deliberately a
best-effort upgrade: the renderer has already titled the pane with its string
heuristic by the time a request lands here, so every failure path returns a
structured error and the pane simply keeps the heuristic title.

Two things separate this from generate_commit_message, and both come from the
trigger being automatic rather than a button press:

* a semaphore, because restoring a workspace can start a dozen panes at once
  and they would otherwise hit Ollama simultaneously;
* a cooldown, because when Ollama is absent or too slow every new pane would
  otherwise pay for discovering that again.
