"""Periodic pymalloc arena probe.

Background (issue #23): the backend's steady-state footprint is dominated by
retained pymalloc arenas — 1 MB anonymous mappings CPython only returns to the
OS once an arena becomes *completely* empty. One surviving object pins a whole
megabyte, so a long-lived process settles at a high-water mark it never gives
back: 4012 arenas (3.9 GB) after 19 h in the field, 580 after 46 min locally.

Measurement showed the count is flat while idle and only steps up at discrete
events. So the useful instrument is not a gauge, it is a *jump detector*: a
cheap periodic sample that stays quiet until the water rises, which is what
turns "4 GB after 19 h" into "these events did it". With NAVIDE_MEM_TRACE=1 a
jump also dumps the top allocators, answering *what* and not just *when*.

Peak RSS alone is not enough to drive that detector on macOS. A page that goes
cold is compressed out of the resident set while still counting toward the
process footprint, so growth that has already cooled moves the footprint but
not the RSS. Measured in the field: a backend held 2195 arenas (2.14 GB, of
which 2.09 GB was compressed) and grew 585 of them over 42 hours without ever
tripping the 32 MB peak-RSS threshold — the probe was silent for the entire
window it existed to describe. The detector therefore watches several signals
and reports whichever one rises, so no single blind spot can silence it.

Stdlib plus the `osplat` seam — no new dependency to carry through PyInstaller.
