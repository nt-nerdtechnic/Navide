"""End-to-end encryption for cross-device messages.

Until now a message to another machine travelled through the server as
plaintext: ``messages.send`` wrote the text straight into a table, so the relay
could read everything it carried. That is the one thing Tailscale's DERP
deliberately cannot do — it forwards packets it has no key for — and it is the
gap that has to close *before* a direct path exists, not after. Once some
messages go direct and some go relayed, "was this one encrypted?" becomes a
question the user cannot answer, and that is a worse position than today's
honest "none of them are".

The scheme is a sealed box: the sender needs only the recipient's long-term
public key, and every message gets a fresh ephemeral keypair.

    ephemeral X25519 keypair  ─┐
                               ├─ ECDH ─→ HKDF-SHA256 ─→ 32-byte key
    recipient's public key   ──┘                              │
                                                              ▼
                                        AES-256-GCM(nonce, plaintext, aad)

    wire := b64( ephemeral_pub[32] || nonce[12] || ciphertext+tag )

Three properties worth naming, because each is a decision rather than a default:

*Forward secrecy for the sender half.* The ephemeral private key is discarded
the moment the message is sealed, so a sender's stored state cannot decrypt
what it has already sent. The recipient's long-term key can, which is the
asymmetry a sealed box is: it exists so the sender needs no key of its own and
no handshake — and a handshake is exactly what a store-and-forward relay cannot
carry.

*The recipient is bound into the ciphertext.* Both device ids and the
recipient's public key go in as AEAD associated data, so a ciphertext lifted
from one message cannot be replayed as a message to somebody else — the
server, which routes by device id, would otherwise be able to redirect one.

*No key means no encryption, and that is a decision the caller makes.* This
module never silently falls back to plaintext: ``seal`` requires a key. The
caller decides what to do when a peer has published none, and ``server_link``
refuses to fall back for any peer it has ever seen a key for.
