"""Expose enabled app-managed skills to a pane's CLI agent at spawn time.

Every CLI that has skills discovers them from directories, so the shape is
always the same: build a view directory of symlinks for this agent, then hand
the CLI that path in whatever way it accepts one. The per-vendor part — which
flag, which config key, which layout — is declared in each vendor's
``SkillsWiring`` spec rather than branched on here.

Two rules the vendor specs exist to keep:

- **The user's own skills are never displaced.** Managed names that collide
  with a native ``~/.claude/skills`` entry are dropped from the view, and a
  flag that replaces the CLI's own discovery (kimi's ``--skills-dir``) gets
  the discovery roots passed back alongside ours.
- **A spawn never breaks over skills.** Every failure path returns the command
  unchanged; the worst outcome is a pane without managed skills.
