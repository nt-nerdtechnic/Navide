"""Capability API: the controlled façade a plugin uses to reach core services.

A capability is how the host grants a plugin *scoped* access to a core service.
Each capability class wraps one core service (``fs_service``, ``git_service``,
the terminal service) and exposes a small, deliberate surface -- never the raw
module. The host builds only the capabilities a plugin declares in
``manifest.requires`` (see :func:`build_capabilities`) and injects them into
``PluginContext.capabilities``; a plugin that did not declare ``"git"`` simply
has no git capability to reach for.

Interface-shell status
----------------------
This is the Phase 1 skeleton. Each capability exposes only a few representative
methods -- enough to prove the "authorize + delegate to service" path works end
to end, not the full contract. Method **signatures are provisional**: Phase 2
(the real WS-handler migration) will settle them and route more calls through
here. Every method below is marked accordingly.

Delegation uses a function-level ``from .. import app`` so importing this module
stays cheap and free of import cycles; the core service singletons live on
``app`` (``app.fs_service``, ``app.git_service``, ``app.get_terminals()``).
