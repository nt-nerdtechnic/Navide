"""What this machine has decided to believe about the other ones, on disk.

Three pieces of state decide whether a cross-device message is honoured, and
before this module all three lived in a Python attribute that a restart erased:

*Which signing key belongs to which device.* Without it a signature proves only
that *somebody* holds *a* key — and the relay can mint keys all day. Pinned on
first sight (trust on first use), and a device whose key later changes is
refused rather than re-pinned.

*The highest policy sequence this device has ever signed.* The pane policy is
stored by the server, so the server chooses which version to hand back; without
a locally held high-water mark it can hand back an older one, or none, and
nothing notices.

*Which peers have ever been sent ciphertext.* ``server_link`` refuses to fall
back to plaintext for a peer it has seen a key for, which is the right rule and
was, until now, forgotten on every backend restart — so the relay could get
plaintext simply by dropping a key from the directory and waiting for the next
restart, which is a daily event.

**Why two storage systems.** The state itself goes in the credential vault (the
Keychain on macOS, a 0600 file elsewhere), and a bare "this machine has been
initialised" marker goes in ``navide.db``. They are deliberately in different
places, because the failure this design exists to prevent is *silent* reset: if
both lived together, one `rm` would take the marker with the state and the next
start would look exactly like a first start. Split, a missing state file with
the marker present is a state this machine can recognise and refuse to work in.

**Fail closed, and no upgrade grace.** Marker present but state unreadable means
cross-device traffic stops and the user is told, rather than the pins quietly
starting over. There is no "old installs get one free pass" allowance either: a
grace period is an attacker-reachable reset, repeatable as often as they like,
and the population it would serve does not exist — no shipped build has ever
written any of this.

**The marker records who wrote it, and that is not a loophole.** The first thing
ever to trip this lock was our own verification script, which used to run
against the real app-data directory: it left a marker with no state behind, and
the symptom — cross-device traffic stopping in both directions — is exactly what
a real attacker deleting the state would produce. Someone who did not happen to
know what they had run ten minutes earlier would have investigated the wrong
thing. So the marker carries the program and the time that created it, and the
lock message quotes them. This changes no decision: the lock holds whatever the
provenance says, and nothing here treats a marker as dismissible. It only means
the person reading the message is told a fact instead of having to guess, which
is the same problem as a warning buried under noise — the defence is intact and
the part where *a human finds out* is what got damaged.

The judgement behind all of it: losing a *private key* breaks things visibly, so
it can be regenerated. Losing a *pin* breaks nothing visible and removes a
protection, so it must not be regenerated. Anything that would fail silently is
treated here as an error.

    was nothing here to unpair" are different answers. A call that always
    reported success would make a mistyped device id look like a completed act.

    Four things go, and one deliberately stays.

    *The pin*, which is the pairing itself. Without it the next message from
    that device is a first sighting again: pinned anew, unapproved, announced.
    That is the point — everything approval released is gone, and getting it
    back costs a person another fingerprint comparison.

    *Its notices.* Leaving them would leave the panel asking about a device this
    machine no longer knows, and a "compare these two fingerprints" notice whose
    pinned key has been dropped cannot be acted on any more.

    *Not* its place in the encrypted-peers list either, and for the same reason
    as the sequence. That entry is a promise about a peer — this one has had
    ciphertext, so never accept plaintext from it — and dropping it was
    justified by the rule re-establishing itself the first time the device is
    sealed for again. Between the unpair and that moment, though, the promise is
    simply gone, and the window is one a relay can arrange: downgrade the next
    message to plaintext and it is no longer refused. Keeping a stale entry
    costs nothing but a refusal a person can see and fix.

    *Not* the policy sequence, and this one was the other way round until now.
    That number is what makes an older signed policy unreplayable, so clearing
    it let a device paired again under the same id start from zero — and every
    policy document signed before the unpair verify once more. A server holding
    an old document only had to wait for an unpair, which is a thing users do
    for unrelated reasons. It was dropped to keep the ordinary case tidy: a
    re-paired machine numbering its own new policy below a mark it no longer
    remembers setting. That is a worse trade than it looked, because the tidy
    case is recoverable by saving the rules once and the replay is not
    recoverable at all.

    *Not* ``seenMessages``. Those keys are per message, not per device, and they
    exist so a relay cannot replay something already delivered. Unpairing is not
    a reason to make a delivered message deliverable again, and that ledger
    expires on its own.
