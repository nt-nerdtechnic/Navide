"""Quota-exhaustion account failover: the backend authority.

Plan: .agent-team/plans/quota-exhaustion-auto-switch_7b3e91.html (Phase B/E).

The renderer only *reports* what it saw and *asks* for a switch; everything
that decides whether credentials move lives here:

- ``policy`` — persisted ``off`` / ``notify`` / ``auto`` (default ``notify``).
  ``automatic: true`` on a request is a provenance mark, never an authority.
- ``incidents`` — one exhaustion event per ``(agentKey, authScope,
  outgoingSlotId, epoch)``. Every pane and window that reports the same
  exhaustion lands in the same incident, so a multi-window app switches once.
- ``candidates`` — a pure ranking over the per-account usage snapshots.
- ``budget`` — automatic swaps that actually moved credentials, persisted in
  ``navide.db`` so a backend restart does not reset the 3-per-5h / 10-minute
  spacing. Manual switches keep their own, separate 60-second rule in
  ``ws_handlers.cli_profiles_set_default``.
- ``transactions`` — a switch in flight. Hot vendors commit directly under the
  agent's ``switch_lock``; restart vendors go through prepare → ack → commit,
  and a busy pane parks the transaction in ``waiting-safe`` rather than
  cancelling it. A failure of any kind ends the incident's automatic run
  (``notify-stopped``); there is never a second candidate tried by itself.

Everything about *how* a vendor switches — hot or restart, which credential
pool it shares, whether a restarted pane can resume — is read from the
vendor's ``VendorSpec.account_switch`` declaration (owned by the vendor
files). A vendor that declares nothing is unsupported here and only ever gets
a notification; it never inherits another vendor's behaviour.

Runtime seams are reached the way ``ws_handlers`` reaches them (``from .
import app`` at call time), so the same monkeypatching the profile tests use
drives this module with a temporary vault and database.
