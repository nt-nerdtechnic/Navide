"""Cross-device sync for the Settings → INTEGRATIONS sections.

The wire contract is ``docs/en-US/cloud-sync-protocol.md``; this module is the
client half of it. It knows nothing about prompts, MCP servers or skills — a
*scope adapter* supplies "what does this machine currently hold" and "write
this in", and everything below treats both as opaque JSON.

**The engine never merges and never picks a winner.** That is the decision the
approved plan records: two devices editing the same item produce a conflict
row and a question for the user, not a silent overwrite. Three places enforce
it and all three are needed — a push carries the ``rev`` it is editing from so
the server can refuse a stale write, a pull refuses to apply over local edits
it has not seen pushed, and an item with an unresolved conflict is skipped by
both directions until the user answers.

**A missing key is not a reason to sync in the clear.** Bodies go through
``sync_keyring``, which has no plaintext path; a machine that has not yet been
handed the account key syncs nothing rather than uploading readable records.

**Nothing here can break the app.** Every entry point is called from the link's
own task and every failure is logged and swallowed by the caller: sync is a
convenience laid over state that is already correct on disk.

**The blocking half runs off the loop.** A round reads every skill's file tree
and every instruction file, encrypts each record, and touches SQLite — none of
which is async, and all of which happens inside the backend's own event loop
task. ``loop_watchdog`` calls a 2-second stall a fault and says so in the log,
and a user with a few large instruction files would reach that on an ordinary
sync. So the per-item work is handed to a worker thread in whole batches: one
hop per pull page and one per push, rather than one per item, because the hop
is only worth making if it carries real work.
