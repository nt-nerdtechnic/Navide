"""Onboarding dependency registry + detection.

Single source of truth for the first-run environment wizard. Each `Dep`
describes how to detect a tool and (where safe) how to install it. The frontend
only renders backend-computed status — it never hardcodes commands. Install is
driven by `dep_id` against this whitelist, mirroring the git-config allowlist
security model.

Platform-aware: a dep declares which platforms it exists for and how each one
installs it (`Dep.platforms` / `Dep.install_cmds`). A platform with no install
command gets the docs link rather than a command naming a package manager that
is not there — which is what every entry used to do off macOS.
