"""WebSocket side of push-to-talk voice input (``voice.*``).

Handlers are registered in ws_handlers. One recording at a time: a window
streams base64 s16le mono 16 kHz PCM with ``voice.chunk`` between
``voice.start`` and ``voice.stop``. Nothing here runs until a ``voice.*``
message arrives.

While recording, a per-take loop pushes ``voice.partial`` {sessionId, seq,
committed, tentative} to the recording window about once a second
(LocalAgreement-2 over whisper segments): only the uncommitted window of
audio (about ``WINDOW_CAP_BYTES`` at most) is transcribed; leading segments
(clauses) that two consecutive hypotheses agree on — never the last one, which
may end mid-word — are committed up to a boundary whose timestamp is
trustworthy. Timestamps are only approximate (on a window that ends
mid-speech they can be seconds late), so the next window starts
``_OVERLAP_BYTES`` before that boundary, every new hypothesis — and the tail
pass on stop — first drops the text that repeats the end of the committed text
(``_strip_overlap``, an alignment like whisper_streaming's n-gram overlap
removal), and an advance only stands once the first hypothesis of the new
window re-hears that committed text; otherwise the window rolls back to where
it started, so a late boundary cannot lose words. ``committed`` only ever grows. Stop transcribes what is left of
the window and answers ``committed + tail``, so the final text always starts
with the last committed text the window was shown.
