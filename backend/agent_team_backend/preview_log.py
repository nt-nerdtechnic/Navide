"""Per-workspace record of what the preview panel has been shown.

Three writers feed one feed: the app itself (a user opening a file), an agent
(an MCP call or a Claude hook), and the filesystem watcher, which is the
catch-all for a change nobody claimed. Only the first of those goes through the
renderer, so — unlike ``agent_message_log``, where the renderer mints the uid
and the backend only upserts — this is a backend-authored log and the uid is
minted here as ``<created_at>:<seq>``.

Rows live in the workspace database (``<workspace>/.agent-team/navide.db``)
because a preview record is about a file in that workspace and means nothing
outside it.

The watcher sees the same write the agent already reported, so a naive log
would show every save twice. ``append`` therefore merges: a second row for the
same path and change inside ``MERGE_WINDOW_MS`` folds into the first, and an
attributed row (agent/user) always wins over the anonymous watcher one — it
upgrades a watcher row already on disk, and discards a watcher row arriving
after it. That last case is not left to the window: a hook reports a write
*before* it happens, so the watcher's echo lags by however long the tool takes
to run (a permission prompt, a busy host). An attributed row therefore claims
the next watcher event for its path and change, for up to ``CLAIM_TTL_MS``.

A sqlite failure is logged and swallowed, never raised at the caller; it simply
means the record was not persisted.
