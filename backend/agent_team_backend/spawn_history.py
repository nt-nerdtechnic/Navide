The project document keeps only a 100-entry mirror of the renderer's spawn
history (``Project.ui_spawn_history``) so its read-size cap stays safe. This
store keeps the complete history: ``merge()`` upserts every snapshot the
renderer sends and never deletes older entries, and ``read_page()`` serves
pages back newest-first for the Agent History modal.

Document shape: ``{"version": 1, "entries": [...]}`` with entries ordered
oldest → newest (matching the renderer's in-memory order). The legacy
`.agent-team/spawn-history.json` is imported on first access and renamed
`spawn-history.json.migrated-v1`.

        which stranded its ``.agent-team/manual/<ymd>/<agentKey>-<paneId8>.log``
        forever — those logs are now removed alongside the entry (guarded to
        stay inside the workspace's manual dir, tolerant of missing files).

        Modes:
        - ``"ids"``: entries whose paneId is in ``pane_ids`` (record-only —
          live panes are never touched, only their history entry goes).
        - ``"removed"``: every entry carrying a ``removedAt`` timestamp.
        - ``"older_than"``: removed entries whose ``spawnedAt`` is strictly
          before ``cutoff_iso``. Active entries and entries without a
          parseable spawnedAt are kept — bulk cleanup never deletes the
          record of something that may still be running.

        Starred entries (``starred`` truthy) survive both bulk modes; only
        an explicit ``"ids"`` delete removes them.

        ``dry_run=True`` answers "what would this delete?" — same selection
        and same log-file resolution, but nothing is written and nothing is
        unlinked. It backs the renderer's delete confirmation, which has to
        name the transcript files and the disk space at stake before the user
        agrees.

        Unknown mode deletes nothing. The rewrite is atomic (one kv
        transaction) and skipped entirely when nothing matched. Each
        workspace's store is keyed by its canonical path, so entries of other
        workspaces are never affected. ``seed`` mirrors read_page(): a
        missing document is first migrated from the project mirror so the
