"""Plan-document discovery plus a per-workspace ``plan-meta`` cache.

Two operations back the plans list:

- :meth:`PlanIndex.list_docs` — scan every plan/report directory in one pass and
  return ``(rel_path, name, mtime)`` per document, each carrying the cached meta
  when the cached mtime still matches the file on disk.
- :meth:`PlanIndex.cache_put` — store the meta a caller parsed, keyed by
  ``rel_path`` + mtime.

The cache is **never the source of truth**. An entry whose mtime does not match
the file is reported as a miss and the caller re-reads that file; a missing or
unusable database degrades to "every document is a miss", so the list stays
complete either way. Parsing also stays in one place (the frontend plan stores,
which own both the HTML-island and the markdown-frontmatter formats) — this
module treats meta as an opaque JSON payload and never interprets it.

Storage is the workspace database (``<workspace>/.agent-team/navide.db``).
Reads go through ``WorkspaceDatabases.peek`` so that merely listing a folder's
plans never plants a database in someone's project; the file is created on the
first :meth:`cache_put`, i.e. only once the workspace actually has plan
documents.
