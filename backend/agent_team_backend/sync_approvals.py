"""Approval before a synced skill or MCP server can run here.

A record another device sends can carry something this machine will execute:
an MCP server's command, a skill's scripts. Applying it on arrival meant one
compromised device could run code on every other device of the account. So a
record that is *new here*, or that changes what would run, is held instead of
applied — not written, not enabled, not projected to any CLI, no executable
bit — until the user approves it in the main window. A change that does not
touch what runs (a skill switched off, a rotated token in an MCP env) and a
deletion behave as before.

The skills install gate (``skills_approvals``) is the model: a pending
request, approve or reject in the window, the write only on approval. It is
not reused as-is because its records live in memory and point at installer
previews. A held sync record has to survive a restart: while it waits, the
adapter shows the engine the held payload in place of the local item (see
``overlay``), so the engine sees agreement and pushes nothing. Forgetting the
hold on a restart would make the next round push this machine's old copy over
the change on every other device. Hence:

- the index is a store of its own, ``index.json`` beside the payloads under
  the app data directory — not a UI setting, which the window may write —
  as ``{scope: {item_id: {digest, base, status, kind, summary, at}}}``. The
  summary — everything the user is shown, whole — is sealed under the
  account key like the payload, so the file keeps no secret in the clear;
- each payload is sealed under the account key, the same way it travelled;
- an approval is a token sealed under that key too (``_approval_token``),
  written only by ``decide``: a hand-edited ``status`` approves nothing.

What the user approves is exactly and completely what lands: a summary
that cannot hold the whole record is refused (the adapter reports it), never
held as a stub, and a stub found in the index is never approvable.

Bounded: at most ``MAX_HOLDS_PER_SCOPE`` records per scope *waiting* — a
full queue refuses the next record (``full_scopes`` says so) rather than
making room. A rejection is never evicted to make room: dropping one would
let this machine's own copy (or its absence, a delete) go up over the
change it rejected.

A rejection is kept: the cloud copy goes on standing in for the local item, so
nothing is pushed back, until a newer record for the item arrives — which is
a new request. A local edit of the item while it waits ends the hold: the edit
is the user's newer decision and syncs as one.
