"""Cursor CLI (`agent`, legacy `cursor-agent`) conversation store reader.

Layout (root = ~/.cursor/chats — Cursor offers no official env override for
its data home, so the root is fixed; tests relocate it via Path.home()).
Sampled 2026-08-16 against a live cursor-agent 2026.08.11-e8db854 session:

  ~/.cursor/chats/<project-hash>/<session-uuid>/store.db    one db per session
  ~/.cursor/chats/<project-hash>/<session-uuid>/meta.json   plain-JSON sidecar

  store.db has exactly two tables:
    meta  (key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT) — single row (key '0'), value =
                  hex-encoded JSON (agentId, latestRootBlobId,
                  blobEncryptionKey, createdAt; NO cwd)
    blobs (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, data BLOB) — content-addressed (SHA256 keys)
                  and MIXED: some rows are plain JSON chat messages
                  ({"role": "system"|"user"|"assistant", "content": …}), the
                  rest are protobuf structure nodes with no public schema.
                  Protobuf rows are NEVER decoded — they fail json.loads and
                  are skipped, and the marker scan only reads their raw bytes
                  (user input is embedded verbatim as UTF-8, which is how the
                  kickoff's `at-pane:<paneId>` marker is found).

  meta.json is the only place the workspace is recorded:
    {"schemaVersion":1,"createdAtMs":…,"hasConversation":true,
     "updatedAtMs":…,"cwd":"/abs/path"}

  <project-hash> is md5(cwd) hexdigest — community-documented (agentgrep) and
  CONFIRMED 2026-08-16 (md5 of the sampled meta.json cwd equals the dir name).
  Cursor is still closed source, so it stays a best-effort workspace filter
  and never gates marker binding (markers are globally unique).

  ~/.cursor/acp-sessions/<id>/store.db (ACP mode) is intentionally ignored,
  as is ~/.cursor/projects/<slug>/agent-transcripts/*.jsonl — that is Cursor
  IDE data, not the CLI's.

Token usage: none is emitted (parse_session_file/parse_incremental return
empty). The JSON blobs carry no usage, and whatever the store keeps lives in
the protobuf nodes, which are out of reach. The headless
`--output-format stream-json` path does report usage per result (sampled:
inputTokens / outputTokens / cacheReadTokens / cacheWriteTokens, with
inputTokens EXCLUDING cacheReadTokens — Anthropic's convention, the opposite
of Meta/OpenAI), but `--print` runs one prompt and exits, so it can never
observe an interactive pane. Left unimplemented on purpose.

Activity: parse_activity watermarks on blobs.rowid (monotonic per INSERT) and
turns each new JSON message row into an event — role=user → agent_active,
role=assistant → turn_complete carrying the reply text. That turn_complete is
what lets a Cursor pane send inter-CLI messages: the frontend only parses the
---MSG-START--- protocol out of a turn_complete that has text. Nothing else is
reported: there is deliberately NO db-write heartbeat (see parse_activity).

Everything here is maximally defensive: any missing table, unexpected
schema, undecodable value, or sqlite error is tolerated by silently skipping
that db — never by raising.

resume: `agent --resume=<chatId>` (session id = the <session-uuid> dir name).
