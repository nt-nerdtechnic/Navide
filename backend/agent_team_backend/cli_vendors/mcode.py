"""MiniMax Code (``mcode``) — MiniMax's terminal coding agent.

Verified against mcode 0.4.12 (npm ``@minimax-ai/code``) on macOS.

What this spec deliberately leaves unset, and why — every one of these was
probed against the real binary rather than read off the docs, because the
published reference mixes the interactive command's flags with those of the
``exec`` subcommand, and Navide only ever spawns the interactive one:

* **No model or effort capability.** ``mcode --help`` lists exactly five
  options for the interactive command: ``--lane``, ``--session``,
  ``-c/--continue``, ``--tui-mode`` and ``--version``. ``--model`` and
  ``--effort`` exist only under ``mcode exec``. This matters more here than
  for the vendors that silently drop an unknown flag: mcode is strict, so
  passing one is not merely ignored —

      $ mcode --bogus-flag-xyz
      error: unknown option '--bogus-flag-xyz'

  — the process exits and the pane never starts. A guessed flag here is a
  dead pane, not a degraded one.

* **No permission-bypass flag.** The interactive command has none. mcode's
  unattended mode is a *setting*, not an argument: ``permissionMode`` in
  ``<data-dir>/config.yaml`` (``default``/``auto``/``bypassPermissions``/
  ``off``), or Alt+M inside the TUI. ``--permission <policy>`` belongs to
  ``mcode exec`` and is rejected by the interactive command, so YOLO mode
  cannot be expressed as argv for this vendor.

* **No session resume.** ``--session <id>`` does exist on the interactive
  command, but Navide can only use it if something can name the id of a
  session it just started, and that means a log reader. mcode stores its
  conversations in SQLite — ``<data-dir>/v2/sqlite/runtime-state.sqlite``
  (WAL), with ``local_runtime_sessions`` (session_id, workspace_dir, title)
  and ``local_runtime_message_rows`` (role, turn_id, data_json) — which is a
  shape no existing reader covers, and the row payloads cannot be honestly
  modelled without an authenticated session to read. Left unset until one
  exists; the schema is recorded here so that work starts from a fact.

* **Account switching (source-read, then checked against the CLI's own
  auth module on synthetic tokens; no real login).** Read from the 0.4.12
  package (chunks/chunk-WAVNKSSE.js, ``J``/``L``/``G``):

  - the credential file is ``<data-dir>/auth/auth.json`` —
    ``{"schemaVersion": 1, "records": {"<service>NUL<account>": <credential>}}``
    with ``service = com.minimax.mcode.oauth.<buildEnv>.<region>`` and
    ``account = base64url(sha256("<data-dir>/auth" + NUL + "mcode-public"))``
    (the hash names the data dir, not the person), credential =
    {schemaVersion 1, accessToken, refreshToken, tokenType "Bearer", clientId
    "mcode-public", scopes, audience "agent-backend", expiresAtMs,
    generation, loginEpoch?, subject?, accountId?};
  - the state file is ``<data-dir>/auth/<buildEnv>/<region>/mcode-public/
    auth-state.json`` (schemaVersion 2, status, storeKind "file", clientId,
    scopes, audience, buildEnv, region, generation, expiresAtMs), under the
    CLI's ``auth.lock`` (proper-lockfile: a ``auth.lock.lock`` directory
    while held, stale after 30 s);
  - ``buildEnv`` is "prod" for the released package; ``region`` is "cn" or
    "en", chosen by ``MAVIS_REGION``, then ``preferences/mcode-region.json``
    (``{"version": 1, "regions": {"prod": "cn"}}``), then whichever region
    has an active state, then "cn".

  Rules checked on 0.4.12's own ``getStatus`` with synthetic files (scratch
  probe, temp data dir): credential and state must carry the SAME
  ``generation`` (mismatch → status "error"); a pair swapped whole is
  accepted in either direction, a lower generation included; a state left
  "authorizing" with a newer credential self-heals; a missing credential
  under an "authenticated" state is "error"; ``auth.json`` and the auth dir
  must be private (0600 / 0700) or reads raise. Hence the adapter: the
  profile scope is the region, ``extract``/``merge`` touch one namespace
  record of ``auth.json`` (re-keyed to the live data dir's hash, so a login
  harvested from another data dir lands under the right key), and
  ``companion_writes`` derives ``auth-state.json`` for that namespace from
  the credential just written (anonymous, generation+1, when removed). The
  region preference file is left alone: switching to an account of the other
  region is refused by ``merge`` unless that region is the CLI's current one.
  Not seen on a real account; ``evidence`` says so.

What is verified and set: ``MINIMAX_DATA_DIR`` really does relocate the whole
data root. Pointing it at an empty directory and running the CLI creates the
entire tree there (``config.yaml``, ``auth/``, ``v2/sqlite/``, ``agents/``,
``plugins/``) and leaves ``~/.minimax`` untouched — checked explicitly.

That is what makes it a ``home_env_vars`` entry, and the field is a guard
rather than an injection: the backend strips these names from its own
inherited environment and from probe spawns, and ``spawn_env_deny_list``
refuses a spawn request that tries to set one. Verified over the real socket —
a ``terminal.create`` carrying ``MINIMAX_DATA_DIR=/tmp/attacker-controlled``
reached the process with no MINIMAX var at all, and the window was told why
via ``cli.env_ignored`` (``denied: ["MINIMAX_DATA_DIR"]``).
