"""Meta Muse Code — spawn, install detection, resume parsing and log reader.

Muse Code is a terminal coding agent Meta released in beta for macOS and
Linux; it installs from a shell script rather than a package manager and is
driven by the ``muse`` binary (``muse exec`` for headless runs). Resuming from
the CLI is the subcommand ``muse resume <id>``, which is the shape
``resume_id_from_command`` parses back out.

Session log layout (data root = ``$XDG_DATA_HOME``, default
``~/.local/share``)::

  <data-root>/muse/sessions/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/<session-id>/session.jsonl
  <data-root>/muse/sessions/.../<session-id>/subagent/<child-id>/session.jsonl
  <data-root>/muse/sessions/.../<session-id>/tool-outputs/

The three date levels are the LOCAL date the session opened, and the session
DIRECTORY's name is the session id (every log file is named session.jsonl).

Every line is an envelope::

  {"schema_version":1,"id":"…","stream":{"kind":"session","id":"<session-id>"},
   "sequence":42,"recorded_at":1786491820389652,"record_type":"event",
   "payload_type":"runtime.session","payload":{"kind":"run","event":{…}}}

``stream.id`` equals the directory name and is the only id ``muse resume``
accepts. The ids INSIDE the payload — ``event.record.owner.session_id``,
``command_intake``'s ``command_id`` and ``session_stream.id`` — are internal
COMMAND ids and differ from it (observed: directory ``b3ef50f0-…`` alongside
``owner.session_id`` ``4c39ad2b-…``); binding to one of those makes every
resume fail, so the session id is only ever taken from the directory name.

``recorded_at`` is a MICROsecond unix timestamp (16 digits) and ``sequence``
increases monotonically.

Field map (every entry verified against real session files):

  cwd            payload_type ``runtime.session.metadata``
                 -> ``payload.record.workspace_root``
  user prompt    payload_type ``runtime.command_intake.received``
                 -> ``payload.record.command.prompt``, only when
                 ``payload.record.command.kind == "turn_submit"``
  assistant text ``event.kind == "assistant_message_committed"``
                 -> ``event.text``
  turn end       ``event.kind == "terminal"`` -> ``event.terminal``
                 (observed "completed"/"failed"; also ``reason``,
                 ``turn_duration_ms``) — an EXPLICIT end-of-turn record, so
                 nothing here infers a turn boundary from silence
  tokens         ``event.kind == "goal_usage_attribution"`` ->
                 ``event.record.quantity.{input,output,cached,reasoning}_tokens``
                 deduped on ``event.record.usage_id``

Token mapping into TokenUsage — the four quantity fields are NOT added up;
``cached_tokens`` and ``reasoning_tokens`` are breakdown detail already
contained in the two totals::

  input_tokens  = quantity.input_tokens
  output_tokens = quantity.output_tokens

muse's own JSONL event schema is not published (``goal_usage_attribution``
appears nowhere in Meta's docs), so this is INFERRED from the semantics of the
Meta Model API that muse runs on — not from a muse definition. The three
upstream statements it rests on:

* https://dev.meta.ai/docs/prompt-caching.md — "``cached_tokens`` is a subset
  of your input tokens, not an extra charge. The cached prefix is still
  counted once in ``input_tokens``".
* https://dev.meta.ai/docs/reasoning.md — "Reasoning tokens count toward both
  your output-token limit and billed completion tokens".
* https://dev.meta.ai/docs/protocols/responses.md — the usage example is
  ``{input_tokens: 69, output_tokens: 163, total_tokens: 232}`` (69 + 163 =
  232), with the breakdown living in ``input_tokens_details.cached_tokens``
  and ``output_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens``. muse's four flat fields are
  that object with the ``*_details`` nesting flattened away.

Same-shaped precedent: copilot's ``assistant_usage_events.input_tokens``
likewise already includes cache reads (measured: 19898 = 9 + 0 + 19889), and
the additive fold there over-reported by roughly double until it was changed
to pass the fields through as-is. (Anthropic is the counterexample that stops
this being generalised: its cache fields ARE additive by documented
definition, so the answer has to come from the provider behind each CLI.)

STILL TO VERIFY, and the only thing that turns the inference into fact: run a
real muse session against a NON-echo provider and confirm
``cached_tokens <= input_tokens`` and ``reasoning_tokens <= output_tokens``.
Every ``goal_usage_attribution`` row in every local session is ALL ZERO (they
were recorded with ``--provider echo``), so ``_main_usage`` returns None for
all of them and the token path has only ever run on synthetic fixtures.

Only rows with ``event.record.owner.requester_kind == "main"`` are counted:
a subagent's usage is attributed into the PARENT log too, and the child's own
``subagent/<id>/session.jsonl`` repeats it, so counting the non-main rows —
or the child files — would double-count. ``event.kind == "model_completed"``
carries the same figures per model call (``event.usage.*`` plus
``duration_ms``) and is deliberately not counted for the same reason.
``quantity.reported`` is a bool the log carries but nothing here filters on:
an unreported row that is genuinely empty is already dropped by the
all-zero check.

Kickoff markers work: ``at-pane:<id>`` lands verbatim in the intake record's
prompt, so marker binding reads it straight out of the file.

Capabilities still unset on purpose:

* ``session_path`` — a known id maps to a directory name, but not to a single
  path: the three date levels are the (unknown) day the session opened. The
  discoverable form is ``session_exists``, which globs those levels.
* credential fields, ``login_home_env``, ``fetch_usage`` — Meta documents
  ``META_API_KEY``, ``muse auth set`` and ``muse logout``, but not where a
  stored credential lives, and no env var relocating the config home
  (settings are read from ``~/.config/muse/settings.json``). Quota is a web
  dashboard only; there is no CLI usage command to call.
