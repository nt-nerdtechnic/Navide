"""Per-vendor CLI knowledge — the one-file-per-vendor contract.

Every piece of code that concerns exactly one CLI vendor (usage reading,
credential file layout, resume-id parsing, session lookup, env vars, log
reader, attribution quirks) lives in that vendor's module in this package.
Shared modules are allowed to contain orchestration only — no per-vendor
branches; multi-vendor wire protocols live in ``_protocols.py``.

Migration model (strangler fig): every capability field below defaults to
``None``, meaning "not migrated yet". Dispatch sites consult the registry
first and fall back to their legacy branch when the field is ``None``, so an
empty spec changes nothing. A vendor's round moves its knowledge here and
deletes the legacy branch; the final cleanup round removes the bridges.

Vendor modules may import only this module, ``_protocols``, the standard
library, and httpx (enforced by ``test_cli_vendors_registry.py``); the single
exception is kilo importing opencode's reader class (inheritance, not logic
sprawl). In particular a vendor module must never import app/ws/vault
modules — those import the registry, and a back-edge would be a cycle.

    # CLI exposes a way in has not been established either way.

    # --- skills wiring ---
