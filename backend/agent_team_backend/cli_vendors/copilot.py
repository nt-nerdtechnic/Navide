"""GitHub Copilot CLI conversation log reader.

TWO storage layouts live under the root ($COPILOT_HOME, default ~/.copilot);
the reader dispatches on the file NAME:

  <root>/session-store.db                     — every version (central SQLite)
  <root>/session-state/<uuid>/events.jsonl    — 1.0.75 only (per-session JSONL)
  <root>/session-state/<uuid>/workspace.yaml  — id / cwd / timestamps

`<uuid>` (the session-state dir name, = sessions.id in the store) is the exact
id `copilot --resume=<id>` accepts, in both layouts.

They are NOT two generations that never overlap: 1.0.75 wrote BOTH. Measured
on the local data for session e6495800-dfd4-4a75-b2ab-d70980f83b89:

  events.jsonl session.start   copilotVersion 1.0.75  18:33:56.867Z
  sessions.created_at (store)                         18:33:56.866Z
  assistant_usage_events                              input 19898 / output 39
  events.jsonl session.shutdown modelMetrics          input 19898 / output 39

One run, one millisecond apart, identical totals. What 1.0.78 changed is only
that it STOPPED writing events.jsonl — so a 1.0.75 session carries two
complete, independent records of the same tokens. See "Never counted twice".

── 1.0.78+: session-store.db ────────────────────────────────────────────────
Copilot CLI 1.0.78 moved session data into one central SQLite store and stopped
writing events.jsonl at session start: the only local events.jsonl records
copilotVersion 1.0.75 in its own session.start line, while every session dir
created afterwards has none. Every read path used to take events.jsonl as its
ONLY input, so 1.0.78 sessions were silently invisible — no tokens, no
agent_active, no turn_complete (which also broke pane auto-naming, marker
binding, Agent History and inter-CLI messaging for Copilot panes).

Tables consumed (schema_version 6):
  * sessions(id, cwd, …)            — cwd, so workspace.yaml is not needed.
  * turns(id, session_id, turn_index, user_message, assistant_response,
    timestamp) — one row per completed turn. The row IS the turn boundary
    (measured: turn row 18:34:04.115 vs the 1.0.75 assistant.turn_end
    18:34:04.104), so unlike grok no idle-timeout inference is needed.
    user_message is the VERBATIM user text, so kickoff at-pane markers land
    here.
  * assistant_usage_events(id AUTOINCREMENT, session_id, model, input_tokens,
    output_tokens, cache_*_tokens, reasoning_tokens, created_at) — written per
    API call, i.e. live during a turn. This also fixes the long-standing
    events.jsonl defect where a long-running session showed 0 tokens until
    shutdown/compaction.

Token buckets (verified live against the local store, and byte-identical to
the same session's 1.0.75 events.jsonl): input_tokens ALREADY includes
cache_read_tokens + cache_write_tokens (19898 = 9 input + 0 cache_read +
19889 cache_write, cross-checked against token_details_json), and
output_tokens already includes reasoning_tokens. They therefore map STRAIGHT
onto TokenUsage's cache-folded-into-input / reasoning-folded-into-output
design — re-adding the cache columns would double-count.

Known semantic difference vs the 1.0.75 path: the turn boundary and the user
text only become visible when the turn ENDS, so pane auto-naming and marker
binding land one turn later than they used to. Since the store now serves
1.0.75 sessions too (see below), that latency applies to every Copilot pane.
cursor / opencode already have comparable latency.

── 1.0.75: events.jsonl (fallback only) ─────────────────────────────────────
Every line is `{type, data, id, timestamp, parentId}` (ISO 8601). Types:
  * user.message       — data.content is the VERBATIM user text.
  * assistant.message  — data.content / data.model (activity + turn text).
  * assistant.turn_end — explicit end-of-turn record → turn_complete.
  * session.shutdown   — data.modelMetrics.<model>.usage carries the run's
                         token buckets; compaction events carry the same shape
                         mid-run.
usage.inputTokens already folds cacheRead+cacheWrite and usage.outputTokens
already folds reasoning (same convention as the store). Totals appear only on
shutdown / compaction and are point-in-time snapshots, so they are treated as
CUMULATIVE like the Codex reader: emit the delta against the previous
snapshot, and silently reset the baseline when totals shrink (session
rotation, or a resumed run restarting its in-process counters — this never
double-counts, at worst it undercounts a resumed run).

Never counted twice: disjoint dedup_key prefixes are NOT a defence. The two
branches differ in both dedup_key (`copilot_usage::` vs `copilot_cumulative::`)
and file_path, and tokens_store dedups on dedup_key alone — so nothing
downstream can tell that a 1.0.75 session's store rows and its events.jsonl
snapshot describe the same tokens, and both would be credited. The store is
therefore the single authority: the whole events.jsonl branch (tokens AND
activity) bails out for a session id that `session-store.db` already lists in
`sessions` (`_db_owns_session`). events.jsonl is read only when the store is
missing, unreadable, or does not know the session — which also covers the
never-ruled-out case of 1.0.78 creating events.jsonl lazily, since a session
the store knows is served by the store either way.

Concurrency: the copilot process owns the store's writer, so every connection
here is read-only (`file:…?mode=ro`), short-lived and busy-tolerant — any
sqlite error is "no new data this cycle". The FIRST such error also emits one
WARNING, because this whole class of breakage went unnoticed for weeks
precisely because the reader never said anything when its input vanished.
