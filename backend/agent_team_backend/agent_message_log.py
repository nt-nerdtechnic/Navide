"""Append-only persistence for the inter-CLI message log.

The renderer's message log (`useAgentMessaging`) is a capped in-memory list
that dies with the window. This store mirrors it into the global
``<app_data>/navide.db`` so it survives a reload or a restart. The log is
cross-workspace by construction (a message can address a pane in another
workspace), so it lives in the global database, not a per-workspace one.

``uid`` is supplied by the renderer (``<boot-hex>:<local-seq>``) and is
globally unique; the backend never mints ids, which keeps re-sending the same
row idempotent (upsert). ``uid`` is an opaque key — it is *not* ordered, so
every read and the prune order by ``created_at`` plus the backend-assigned
``seq`` insertion counter, which breaks the ties that ``created_at``
(millisecond resolution) produces for a fan-out queued in one tick.
``from``/``to`` are reserved-ish words in SQL, hence the
``sender``/``recipient`` columns.

Surviving a backend restart is this store's entire purpose, so — unlike
history_store, which serves hot per-run tails — there is no in-memory mirror:
``tail()`` always reads the database, and what it returns is exactly what is
persisted. A sqlite failure is logged and swallowed, never raised at the
caller; it simply means the data was not persisted.

        ``pending_incoming`` exists to answer "is anything waiting?", so its

        recipient as the one party who could not read its own mail, while it
        could read another pane's raw log wholesale. This closes that gap: the
        ``content`` here is the stored body verbatim — never shortened, and
        never whitespace-collapsed, so indentation, blank lines and code blocks
        arrive as the sender wrote them.

        "Verbatim" means as stored, which is not always as sent: ``append``
        clamps a body longer than ``MAX_CONTENT_CHARS`` (64K *characters*, so a
        CJK message costs ~3x that in UTF-8) down to that length with a
        ``…[truncated]`` marker. Nothing here can recover what the write threw
        away, so a body ending in that marker was cut at ingest, not by this
        read.

        ``include_delivered`` off (the default) selects the same statuses as
        ``pending_incoming`` — ``queued`` and ``delivering``, the second being
        an injection in flight rather than one that landed. Turning it on adds
        ``delivered``, which is how a recipient re-reads a message it has
        already been handed; ``failed`` and ``cancelled`` stay out either way,
        since neither was ever put in front of this agent.

        Ordered by ``created_at`` then ``seq``, oldest first — the same order
        every other read here uses, and for the same reason: ``uid`` is minted
        by the renderer as ``<boot-hex>:<local-seq>``, an opaque key that sorts
        lexically (``a3f9:100`` before ``a3f9:2``) and restarts at each boot, so
        it says nothing about when a row was written. ``created_at`` alone is
        not enough either, because it is millisecond-resolution ``Date.now()``
        and a fan-out queued in one tick ties on it; ``seq``, the backend's
        insertion counter, breaks those ties. ``limit`` keeps the *newest*
        matching rows (then returns that window oldest first), matching
        ``pending_incoming`` and ``tail``.

        Each row carries ``uid``, ``sender``, ``status``, ``content``, ``kind``,
        ``created_at``, ``reply_to`` and ``correlation_id`` (see
        ``_add_threading`` for the last two — both NULL for a message between
        two panes of one window, which is never routed and so never named by
        anything but its ``uid``). ``kind`` is what separates a peer's message (NULL)
        from something Navide wrote about the caller's own traffic
        (``notice``) or a spawned pane's unreported turn (``fallback``) — a
        caller that treats every row as peer mail will answer Navide.

        Two things a caller must not read into an empty list. A sqlite failure
        is logged and swallowed, as everywhere else in this module, and comes
        back as ``[]`` — indistinguishable from a genuinely empty inbox, so
        "no rows" is never proof that nothing was sent. And the table is
        globally capped at ``MAX_ROWS`` across *every* workspace and pane, not
        per recipient, so a busy log can prune this recipient's older messages
        before it ever reads them.
