"""Tainted panes: panes that received text from outside the local user.

A pane is marked when a message from a chat channel, another device, another
pane, or an MCP client is delivered into it; a human typing never marks it.
The mark lives in navide.db so it survives restarts, and it follows pane-id
aliases: a pane restored under a new id inherits its former id's mark.
Only the renderer (``guard.taint.clear`` ws request) clears it.

Every marking delivery is also recorded as an event carrying the message's
routing key, so the badge can show what was actually sent: the text itself
stays in the message log and is looked up by that key.
