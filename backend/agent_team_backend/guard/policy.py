"""Level x source (x taint) -> allow / ask / deny.

Pure and deterministic; the matrix is the approved plan's decision table
(Phase 0 decisions recorded in GUARD-CONTRACT.md):

| source \\ level           | critical | high             | normal |
|--------------------------|----------|------------------|--------|
| local                    | ask      | allow (+audit)   | allow  |
| relay (chat approval)    | deny     | deny (need local)| allow  |
| remote / agent           | ask      | allow (+audit)   | allow  |
| tainted pane, any source | ask      | ask              | allow  |

Relay wins over taint: a chat approval can never become "ask", because the
person answering is not at the computer. The relay row also holds while the
Guard switch is off (see enforced()). Unparseable commands count as
"high" on a tainted pane.

The matrix is fixed. What the user edits is the level going into it: a
level per built-in rule (apply_overrides; FLOOR_RULES never below high) and
their own deny / allow patterns (apply_user_rules).
