"""The classifier's built-in rules as the user sees them in Settings.

classify() stays the source of truth for *what* matches; this table only
names each rule id it can report, with its default level, so the policy layer
can re-grade a verdict with the user's per-rule levels (store
``guard_rule_overrides``). "Unanalyzable" rules default to normal: by
themselves they only mark a verdict as not statically judgeable, which the
fixed taint escalation in policy.effective_level() handles.

FLOOR rules can be lowered to high at most, never off: they are the actions a
single mistaken click must not turn into a silent allow.
