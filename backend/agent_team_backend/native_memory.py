"""The instruction files each CLI loads on its own -- listed, read and saved.

Every coding CLI reads a markdown file before it starts working: claude reads
``CLAUDE.md``, codex and most others read ``AGENTS.md``, qwen reads
``QWEN.md``, cursor reads ``.cursor/rules/*.mdc``. They are the highest-leverage
configuration a user owns, and until now Navide could not show them at all --
a user had to remember where fourteen CLIs each keep theirs.

Unlike ``native_skills`` and ``native_mcp``, this module **writes**: the page it
feeds is an editor, not a mirror. Two rules keep that safe:

- **Only files the table names.** ``read`` and ``save`` resolve their argument
  against the same candidate set ``scan`` produces and refuse anything else, so
  the WS surface cannot be turned into arbitrary filesystem access. The
  workspace half of that set is treated as untrusted input, because it arrives
  with a clone: a project row whose real path leaves the workspace is dropped
  rather than listed, and the ``read:`` entries of a workspace
  ``.aider.conf.yml`` may only name files inside that same workspace.
- **A save is atomic, and never blind.** Text goes to a sibling temp file and
  is renamed over the target, so a crash mid-write cannot truncate a user's
  instructions; and a save carrying the mtime it read refuses to overwrite a
  file something else has touched since, because these files are edited by
  the CLIs themselves as often as by hand.

The unit listed is the *file*, not the CLI, because one file is usually read by
several CLIs: ``~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`` is claude's own and is also loaded by
kilo and opencode. A row therefore carries every reader, and the same path is
never listed twice.

Every CLI in the registry is covered, and every path was verified on
2026-08-28 against the installed binary -- the code that builds the path, not
a filename string, and for muse and cursor a live run in an isolated tree --
rather than against documentation, which was wrong about cursor (it claims
user rules never touch disk) and silent about droid's ``FACTORY_HOME_OVERRIDE``.
Two consequences worth knowing while reading the table: cursor has no
user-scope loader at all -- its ancestor walk simply reaches ``$HOME`` while
the workspace lives under it -- and aider has no filename of its own, so its
rows come from whatever ``read:`` in the user's ``.aider.conf.yml`` names.

One limit the table does not model: several CLIs let an environment variable
move their config root -- ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` (muse, opencode, kilo),
``FACTORY_HOME_OVERRIDE`` (droid), ``KIMI_CODE_HOME``, ``KILO_CONFIG_DIR``,
``CODEX_HOME``. All were unset when the paths were verified, and a set one
makes that CLI's rows point at a file it no longer reads rather than at
nothing, so the failure is quiet. Model them here if that ever bites.
