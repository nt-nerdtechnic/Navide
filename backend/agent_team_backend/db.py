"""SQLite persistence layer for Navide-owned data.

One database per ownership domain:
- ``<app_data>/navide.db`` — global stores (settings, token accounting).
- ``<workspace>/.agent-team/navide.db`` — per-workspace stores.

Design constraints (see .agent-team/plans/storage-architecture-decision):
- Explicit transactions only. Connections run in autocommit
  (``isolation_level=None``) and every write goes through
  :meth:`Database.transaction`, which issues BEGIN IMMEDIATE / COMMIT /
  ROLLBACK itself. Python's sqlite3 implicit-transaction default (opens a
  transaction on DML but never commits it) turns a missing ``commit()``
  into silent data loss on shutdown; opting out entirely closes that trap.
- One connection per database, shared across threads behind an RLock
  (``check_same_thread=False``). The backend is a single process with a
  single event-loop writer plus one save thread, so a per-database lock
  suffices. ``journal_mode`` stays at the rollback default so a database
  is exactly one file on disk — backup/restore and "delete to reset"
  flows never have to know about ``-wal``/``-shm`` siblings.
- Document-class stores keep their whole-document read/write API on top
  of the shared ``kv`` table. Record-class stores create their own tables
  through :meth:`Database.migrate`.
- JSON import is idempotent and crash-safe: the import runs inside one
  transaction, completion is recorded in ``schema_meta`` within that same
  transaction, and only then is the source file renamed to
  ``<name>.migrated-v1``. A crash mid-import rolls back to "not migrated";
  a crash between commit and rename re-runs detection, sees the marker,
  and just finishes the rename.
