"""The managed Skills library: ``~/.agents/skills`` plus its delivery state.

The library is the shared root six CLIs already read on their own (codex,
copilot, grok, opencode, muse, cursor), not a private Navide directory: a
skill created here reaches those six without any delivery at all, and the
other five (claude, kimi, pi, qwen, antigravity) get it through the per-pane
views ``skills_wiring`` builds.

Because the root is the user's own directory, Navide only ever writes and
deletes entries it created itself — every one carries a ``.navide`` marker
file. Anything else found there is the user's, listed read-only.
