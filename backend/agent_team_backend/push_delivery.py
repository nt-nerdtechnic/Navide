"""Push delivery: hand a queued message to a CLI without typing it into a pane.

Every ordinary delivery writes the envelope to the pane's PTY stdin, which is
the same thing as typing it: it occupies the CLI's input box, it has to wait
for whoever is at the keyboard, and it is only as reliable as the echo the TUI
happens to produce. Some CLIs offer a second way in, and this module is the one
place that knows how to use them.

Which way a CLI offers is that CLI's own business and is declared by its module
in ``cli_vendors`` (``VendorSpec.push_channel``); this module knows only the
three mechanisms and does the I/O:

- an HTTP SERVER the CLI's own TUI is a client of (opencode, kilo). The pane is
  spawned with a per-pane free port, and a message is appended to the composer
  and submitted over loopback. The text still lands in the input box, so this
  buys atomic insertion rather than freedom from the typing hold.
- a JSONL FILE the CLI watches (qwen). The pane is spawned pointing at a
  per-pane file and a message is one appended line. The text never reaches the
  composer.
- a HOOK PARKED HERE (claude). The CLI runs a background hook that blocks on
  this backend until there is something to say; answering it wakes an idle
  agent with the message as a system reminder, without touching the input box.

Ownership is unchanged: the queue, the rate limit, the log and the FIFO all
stay in the renderer, which decides per message whether to push and falls back
to the PTY the moment a push does not land. Nothing here is a delivery
guarantee — see ``deliver`` for what each mechanism can actually prove.
