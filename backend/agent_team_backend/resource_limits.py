"""User-adjustable resource limits (Settings → General → Resource limits).

Two rules hold for every limit here. Its default is what Navide did before
the limit existed, so nothing that works today changes until the user turns
it on. And it fails open: an unreadable store or a malformed value means "no
limit", never a blocked spawn or a refused action.

The values live in the shared UI settings store (ui_settings), which the
renderer writes and both sides read; the keys below are the contract.
