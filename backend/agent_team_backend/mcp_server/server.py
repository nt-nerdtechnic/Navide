"""Plan MCP server — plan-document tools over streamable HTTP.

Mounted on the backend's FastAPI app in the same process (later phases must
reach in-process singletons like TerminalService, so no stdio subprocess).
The backend has no single "current workspace" — every ws_handler receives
``workspace_path`` per request from the client — so the MCP tools follow the
same convention and take ``workspace_path`` as a call-time argument. A caller
authenticated as a pane may omit it: the tools then use that pane's own
workspace, which is the value Navide's plan window resolves plans against, so
a plan cannot land where the window will not look for it (see
:func:`_caller_workspace`).

Path safety reuses :func:`fs_service._resolve_safe` (the same guard the fs.*
handlers use), plus a plans-subtree containment check on top.

Lifecycle: the SDK's ``StreamableHTTPSessionManager.run()`` is once-only per
instance, so instead of ``FastMCP.streamable_http_app()`` (which caches one
manager forever) this module exposes a thin ASGI endpoint that delegates to
the manager created by the latest :func:`startup` call. ``startup`` /
``shutdown`` are registered as plugin lifecycle hooks (see backend.py) and run
from app.py's startup/shutdown events, which Starlette runs in the same
lifespan task — safe for the anyio task group inside.

    workspace by its bare name; a pane in another workspace window by the
    `<folder>/<pane>` address given here. A caller with no pane identity (host
    / external credential) has no "own workspace" — every target comes back
    with same_workspace false and "you" set to the credential kind ("host" or
    "external"); always use the qualified address. Read-only.

    This is who exists, not who is related to you — the list carries no
    lineage. The panes you opened with cli_open_agent are yours to keep track
    of; that record lives in your own context, not in this answer. Refer to
    them however reads naturally when talking to the user; the word does not
    matter, remembering who you opened does.

    `pane_id` is that pane's internal id. It is the key every `ui.pane.*` action
    takes (`ui.pane.close`, `ui.pane.focus`, `ui.pane.getStatus` via ui_invoke)
    — those reject a pane NAME — and it is also accepted by cli_send,
    cli_send_and_wait, cli_read_log, cli_get_status and cli_wait_idle in place
    of an address. Prefer `address`: it is stable and readable, and it survives
    the pane being rebuilt. Reach for `pane_id` when an address cannot say
    which pane you mean — two targets below with the SAME address are two panes
    sharing a name, and every one of those tools refuses that address as
    "ambiguous-target" rather than guessing between them. Remote targets have no
    local id and carry none, so they can only be addressed by name.

    `offline` marks a pane whose Navide window has lost its connection: it still
    exists and is expected back, but sending to it fails until it returns.

    `hold_reason` appears on a target that has a cli_send message still waiting
    to go in, and names what is holding it ("typing", "mid-turn", "starting",
    "behind", …). It is the same reason the Messages panel shows, and it is
    what makes `busy` explainable — but it exists only while a message sent
    from here is queued for that pane, so its absence says nothing.

    `remote_targets` appears only when this machine is linked to a Navide-Server
    and that server knows of panes on *other* machines. Those are a separate
    list because they are a separate deal: their `address` is the three-part
    `<device>/<workspace>/<pane>` form, the message travels through the server
    (so it can fail in ways a local one cannot — the far machine may be offline,
    or refuse on policy grounds), and there is no reading their output from
    here. Each carries `device` (the machine's human-readable label, or its id
    when the server knows no name), `host_online` (that whole machine is
    reachable) and `status` (the server's own word for the pane). `offline` is
    true when either half says the message would not land right now. Prefer a
    local target when one would do.

    Four tools take that three-part address: cli_send, cli_send_and_wait,
    cli_get_status and cli_wait_idle. So a remote pane can be told something,
    asked something and watched — but never read, stopped or closed, because
    those three need the pane's own machine. Two of them say so: cli_interrupt
    refuses a remote address with "interrupt-local-only" and cli_close_agent
    with "close-local-only". cli_read_log does not — it has no remote branch,
    so the address falls through to the local lookup and comes back
    "unknown-target", which reads like a typo and is not one. `pane_id` is no
    way around any of it: remote targets carry none, so the three-part name is
    the only handle there is.

    That key being absent covers two situations that are not the same: this
    machine has no server link at all, or it has one and no other machine has a
    pane open. cli_whoami's `cloud` key tells them apart, and only the first is
    something the user can go do anything about. Linking itself — signing in,
    pairing a device, trusting or blocking one — moves trust state and is on no
    tool by design: it is the user's to do in Navide's account window, so say
    that rather than looking for a tool that would do it for them.

    """Your own entry, in the same shape cli_list_targets gives you for others.

    cli_list_targets deliberately leaves you out of its `targets` and names you
    only as `you`, a single address string. So every field it hands you about
    everyone else — `pane_id` above all — was the one thing you could not learn
    about yourself. That is what this answers. Read-only.

    `pane_id` is why this exists. It is the key every `ui.pane.*` action takes
    (`ui.pane.close`, `ui.pane.focus`, `ui.pane.getStatus` via ui_invoke) and
    those REFUSE a pane name, so without it you could close or focus any pane
    but your own. It also disambiguates you to cli_read_log and cli_get_status
    when another pane in your workspace shares your name — an address both of
    them refuse as "ambiguous-target".

    `spawned_by` names the pane that opened you, when one did, as
    {pane_id, name, address}. This is the only place that fact survives: the
    name of whoever opened you was written into the words of your kickoff task
    and nowhere else, so a compaction of your context loses it permanently —
    along with any idea of who your finished work should go back to. When that
    pane has since closed, only `pane_id` comes back alongside `gone: true`;
    the key is absent entirely when nobody opened you.

    This is a fact about yourself, not the roster's lineage: cli_list_targets
    still says nothing about who is related to whom, and who *you* opened is
    still yours alone to remember.

    `waiting_on_me` is who is BLOCKED on you at this moment — every caller
    currently parked in a cli_wait_idle or cli_send_and_wait aimed at your
    pane, as [{waiting_s, pane_id?, name?, address?, caller?}], longest wait
    first. Waiting was one-way before this: someone could sit on a two-minute
    budget while you, deciding you had another twenty minutes of digging in
    you, had no way to learn that finishing now was worth more than finishing
    well. Read it before committing to a long stretch of work — a waiter at 90
    seconds is about to time out. `caller` ("host" / "external") stands in for
    a waiter that has no pane and therefore no name. The key is ABSENT when
    nobody is waiting; it is never an empty list. It is also process memory: a
    backend restart forgets every wait, so absence is "nobody is parked on me
    that this backend knows of", not proof that nobody wants your answer.

    `cloud` says whether this machine is linked to a Navide-Server, which is
    what decides whether panes on the user's OTHER machines can be addressed at
    all. `state` is "connected" when they can, and "connecting", "unreachable",
    "unauthorized" or "waiting-for-keychain" when the link exists but is not
    carrying anything right now — each one a different thing to tell the user.
    `device_id` is this machine's own id once the server has issued one. The
    key is ABSENT when no link is configured. Read it when cli_list_targets
    came back with no `remote_targets`: that absence means "no server" and "a
    server, but no pane open on any other machine" alike, and this is what
    tells the two apart. Nothing here is a control: signing in, pairing a
    device, trusting or blocking one all move trust state, so they are the
    user's to do in Navide's account window and are deliberately on no tool.

    `delegation_hint` restates the rule for where delegated work goes (a
    Navide pane via cli_open_agent rather than your own subagents) so that a
    pane which never read the server instructions still meets it here.

    A caller with no pane identity (host / external credential) is not a pane
    and has none of these: it gets {ok, caller} only.
    Returns {ok, caller, name, address, pane_id, workspace_path, agent_key,
    busy, offline, delegation_hint, hold_reason?, spawned_by?, waiting_on_me?,
    cloud?} or {ok: false, error}.

    """Open a new CLI pane and give it a task.

    Delegation rule: work that edits files, runs longer than a few minutes, or
    that the user may want to watch, interrupt or take over goes to a Navide
    CLI pane via cli_open_agent — not to your own subagent facility (Agent /
    Task tools). A pane is visible in Navide, can be opened mid-run and
    outlives your session; a subagent is a black box that hands back one
    summary. Keep subagents for short read-only lookups whose whole result is
    a paragraph.

    `agent` is the CLI to run (e.g. "claude", "codex"), `name` is what the pane
    will be called — that name is also its messaging address, so pick something
    role-shaped like "reviewer" — and `task` is what it should do.

    The pane you open is related to you: you opened it, so its result needs to
    come back to you. When you talk to the user about it, use whatever reads
    naturally — partner, junior, the one you sent out, your child agent. No
    word is prescribed and none is more correct than another; what matters is
    not the label but that you remember who you opened.

    Say both of these in `task`: who opened it (your own name, from
    cli_list_targets' `you`), and who to send the result to when it is done.
    Without that line it finishes, writes the answer to its own screen, and
    nobody ever sees it.

    Pane callers open the pane in their own workspace; `workspace_path` is
    ignored for them. A caller with no pane identity (host / external
    credential) has no workspace of its own, so `workspace_path` is required —
    the pane opens there with no parent, so it has no child/depth counts of
    its own; the workspace's CLI-pane count is still tracked for the advisory
    below.

    `ok: true` means the PANE EXISTS — not that the task arrived. The CLI boots
    and is given the task afterwards, and that half can fail on its own. Check
    it with cli_get_status: `ui.kickoff` is "sent" when the task was observed
    landing, "unverified" when the bytes were written but the only echo was a
    booting CLI repainting (read `ui.buffer`; re-send with cli_send if the
    prompt is empty), or "failed". A failure is ALSO reported by message to a
    pane caller — but only to a pane caller, and only when the injection
    reported failure, which is exactly the case "unverified" exists to cover. For a pane caller, the new pane is asked to report its
    result to you by message when it finishes — but that report is the child
    agent's own output, not a guarantee from Navide: it is held until you are
    between turns, and nothing arrives if the child never writes the block.
    Poll cli_get_status / cli_wait_idle whenever you need to be sure. An
    external or host caller gets no such message at all and must poll.

    `model` names the model the new pane runs, and `effort` its reasoning
    level. Both are optional, and asking a CLI that cannot take them is
    REFUSED rather than ignored — otherwise the pane would start on the
    default and look no different from one that got what it asked for.

    That guarantee covers the vendor, not the value: a CLI that accepts
    `--model` may still reject the id itself, and several report that only
    briefly before continuing on their default. So a refusal here means the
    pane did not open, while silence means it opened — not that the model was
    recognised. Which CLIs accept them differs: most take a
    model, only some take a separate effort — the rest encode effort in the
    model id itself (cursor's `gpt-5.3-codex-high`), and two take neither.
    The refusal names what that CLI accepts, so ask for what you want and
    read the error rather than guessing first. Model ids are not checked
    here — an unknown one is the CLI's own error to report — but effort is
    checked against that CLI's vocabulary before the pane opens.

    Use the returned name, not the one you asked for: a concurrent request may
    have taken that name, in which case yours gets a suffix.

    Refused when the name is taken, the agent key is unknown, or the task is
    empty. A high child/workspace/depth count never refuses the spawn — it
    just gets logged as a diagnostic warning and, on success, also returned
    here as `advisories` (a list of human-readable notes; the key is absent
    when there is nothing to report).
    `pane_id` is the new pane's internal id — the key `ui.pane.close`,
    `ui.pane.focus` and `ui.pane.getStatus` take through ui_invoke, all of which
    refuse a pane NAME. Keep it if you may want to close or focus what you
    opened; `address` remains the right thing to send to.
    Returns {ok, name, address, pane_id, advisories?} or {ok: false, error}.

    Passing `pane_id` REOPENS an existing pane instead of creating one: the
    one whose cli_list_targets row says `realized: false` — a restore
    placeholder holding a saved pane with no CLI behind it. Use the id, not the
    name: the placeholder already owns that name, so asking for it by `name`
    opens a second pane called `<name>-2` and leaves the first one closed.
    `agent`, `name` and `task` are ignored on this path — the pane keeps its
    own, and nothing is injected; send the task with cli_send afterwards (or
    use cli_send(open_target=True) to do both at once). Answers {ok, pane_id,
    name, address, realized, reason, reopened: true}; `reason: "fresh"` means
    a new session with no memory of the earlier conversation. A pane that is
    already open answers reopened: false, reason "already-open" and is left
    alone. Unknown ids are refused with "unknown-pane-id".

    """Send an instruction to another CLI pane, in this or another workspace.

    `to` is a pane name for a pane in your own workspace, or `<folder>/<pane>`
    for one in another workspace window — cli_list_targets shows both forms. A
    caller with no pane identity (host / external credential) has no "own
    workspace" and must always use the qualified `<folder>/<pane>` form. The
    text is delivered verbatim and submitted for the receiving agent to act on,
    once that pane is idle; it is queued if the pane is mid-turn. An unknown or
    ambiguous target is refused rather than guessed.

    `to: "group"` broadcasts instead: every other pane in YOUR OWN tab group,
    in your own workspace. Deliberately narrower than the bare-line protocol's
    `all`, which means every pane in the window regardless of group. Panes in no
    group share one implicit group, so they reach each other rather than nobody.
    A caller with no pane identity has no group and is refused ("no-group").
    The answer is a different shape — {ok, broadcast, group_id, delivered_to,
    recipients: [{name, pane_id, msg_key, accepted, reason?}]} — with ONE
    msg_key per recipient, because each is an ordinary independent message:
    its own rate-limit budget, its own idle hold, its own delivery report. Pass
    each key to cli_check_message separately; `wait_for_delivery_s` does not
    apply to a broadcast and is ignored. An empty `recipients` means your group
    has nobody else in it — not a failure.

    `pane_id` addresses one exact pane and makes `to` unnecessary — copy it from
    cli_list_targets. Reach for it when a name cannot say which pane you mean:
    two panes in one workspace may share a name, and that is refused as
    "ambiguous-target" however the name is spelled. It also survives a rename.
    It names a pane on this machine only, so a cross-device target must still be
    addressed by name. An id follows its pane through a window reload or a
    detach, but a pane restarted around a fresh CLI gets a new one — treat
    "unknown-pane-id" as "read a fresh id from cli_list_targets", not as "that
    pane is gone".

    `reply_to` threads this message onto one you were sent, instead of starting
    a new conversation. Pass back the `correlation_id` of the message you are
    answering — cli_read_incoming reports it, and so does the `re:` field of an
    envelope typed into your pane. The recipient's Messages panel then shows
    this as the answer to that message rather than as an unrelated one, and its
    own cli_read_incoming reports it under `in_reply_to`. An id the receiving
    window never handed out is ignored, exactly as an unrecognised `re:` is:
    the message still goes, it simply arrives unthreaded. Omit it for a message
    that starts a thread — the send is then exactly what it always was.

    One limit, and it is the bare-line protocol's too: `reply_to` does NOT
    travel to another device. The relay frame carries to/sender/text/msg_key
    and nothing else, so threading across machines needs a wire field both ends
    understand — a protocol change, not a routing one (`agent_msg.route` in
    ws_handlers says the same at the same seam). The far side still mints a
    correlation id from the msg_key, so the thread holds over there; what is
    lost is the link back to the row on this machine.

    `kind: "ack"` is for a pure acknowledgement — "got it", "done", "thanks" —
    and it changes what the message IS. An ack is written to the user's message
    log and is NEVER put into the receiving agent's input box: that agent is not
    interrupted, is not woken, and will not know you sent it. Use it to close a
    loop the user is watching without spending another agent's turn. Anything
    the other side has to act on, answer, or even know about must go as an
    ordinary message — an ack carrying an instruction is an instruction nobody
    reads. Any other value is treated as an ordinary message.

    An ack reaches panes on this machine only, `to: "group"` included. A
    `<device>/<workspace>/<pane>` target is refused with `ack-not-relayable`:
    the relay cannot promise a message stays out of an input box on someone
    else's machine, and a guarantee that holds only sometimes is one no agent
    should build on. Send it as an ordinary message if it has to cross devices.

    Delivery is asynchronous: this returns once the message is accepted for
    delivery, not once the other agent has read it. Returns
    {ok, target, cross_workspace, msg_key} or {ok: false, error, error_code}.
    Pass `msg_key` to cli_check_message to learn whether the receiving window
    actually delivered it.

    `wait_for_delivery_s` (0 by default, capped at 120) is the alternative to
    remembering to poll: wait that long for the message to actually go in, and
    answer with what happened. 10-30s is the useful range — the wait costs your
    own turn, and a pane that is mid-turn or being typed in can hold a message
    far longer than that. With it set, the answer also carries:

      - `status: "delivered"` and `settled_after_s` — it went in.
      - `status: "failed"` (or "rejected" for another device) and `reason` —
        the receiving window refused it. `ok` stays TRUE: the send itself
        happened and `msg_key` is real, so re-sending on this would dispatch
        the work twice. Read the reason and decide.
      - `status: "queued"` with `waited_s`, plus `hold` and `held_for_s` when
        the receiving window said why — the message is still waiting. `hold.key`
        is "typing" (someone is at that keyboard), "mid-turn" (the agent is
        working), "behind" (other messages first), "starting", "settling",
        "not-ready" or "gone". Nothing was lost; it goes in when the pane frees
        up, and cli_check_message picks the story up later.

    `error_code` "target-offline" is not "unknown-target": the pane exists but
    its Navide window is disconnected. Wait for it to come back and retry —
    re-sending elsewhere or reopening the pane would duplicate the work.

    A `<device>/<workspace>/<pane>` target names a pane on another machine and
    is relayed through the configured Navide-Server. Copy the address from
    cli_list_targets' `remote_targets` rather than assembling it: `device` may
    be either the machine's id or its name, and only the id is guaranteed not
    to collide with one of this machine's own workspace paths. "device-offline"
    means that machine has no connection at all, so waiting is the only option;
    the receiving device may also refuse on policy grounds, which shows up in
    cli_check_message as status "rejected".

    Three error codes tell apart the ways cross-device sending can fail before
    the message even leaves here, and only the first is about the address:
    "unknown-device" (no server is configured on this machine, so no device but
    this one can be named), "link-offline" (a server is configured but this
    machine is not connected to it — the address may be perfectly good) and
    "link-unauthorized" (this machine's server credential was rejected or
    revoked; retrying cannot help until it is signed in again).

    The two link errors also carry ``link_state`` and ``last_error``, and the
    message says what to do: "connecting" is the only one worth retrying,
    "unreachable" means the address is not answering from here, and
    "unauthorized" means somebody has to sign in again. Telling all three to
    retry shortly — which is what this used to do — is advice that works for
    one of them.

    A target whose cli_list_targets row says `realized: false` is a restore
    placeholder: the window holds the saved pane but no CLI is running behind
    it, so it is busy forever and the message parks until someone opens it.
    The send still succeeds, and the answer says so with
    `target_state: "not-opened"` and a `warning`. `open_target: true` opens it
    first — the same restore the user's click would do, without the "resume
    which?" modal — and only then delivers; the answer then carries
    `opened: {realized: true, reason}`. `reason: "fresh"` means the pane came
    up on a NEW session (resume behavior "never", or the user had chosen start
    fresh for that workspace): the agent does not remember its earlier
    conversation, so say what it needs to know. If the open fails the message
    is NOT sent — {ok: false, error_code: "open-failed", open: {realized:
    false, reason}}. A target that is already open is unaffected by the flag.

    `open_target` applies to ONE named pane only. It is ignored — never
    forwarded, never acted on — for `to: "group"` and for a cross-device
    target: a broadcast must not be able to pull a whole batch of reclaimed
    panes back up, and another machine's placeholders are that machine's to
    open. This is a fixed boundary, not a missing feature.

    `msg_key` is the value cli_send returned. Returns {ok, msg_key, status,
    target, age_seconds, reason?, settled_after_s?, hold?, held_for_s?,
    stale?}. `status` is one of:

      - "queued"    — broadcast for delivery; no window has reported back yet.
                      A message held for a busy pane stays here until it is
                      actually injected.
      - "delivered" — the receiving window injected and submitted it.
      - "failed"    — the receiving window refused or lost it; see `reason`.
      - "rejected"  — only for a message sent to another device: that device's
                      pane policy refuses this sender. Re-sending refuses
                      again; this is a permission question for a human, not
                      something to retry.
      - "cancelled" — withdrawn before it went in, by cli_cancel_message or by
                      someone using the Messages panel. Nothing went wrong and
                      nothing is waiting; resend only if you still mean it.

    `reason` values come from the receiving window: "rate-limit" (too many
    messages between the same pair too quickly), "queue-full" (the target's
    pending-message queue is at its cap), "inject-failed" (typing it into the
    pane did not take), "pane-closed" (the target went away before delivery),
    "no-report" (the delivery attempt never reported an outcome). Two reasons
    do NOT mean something went wrong: "read" pairs with "delivered" and means
    the recipient took the message with cli_read_incoming instead of having it
    typed in, and "cancelled" pairs with the status of the same name.

    On a "queued" message, `hold` is why it has not gone in yet — {key, n?},
    the same reason the Messages panel shows — and `held_for_s` is how long it
    has been that way. `hold.key` is "typing" (someone is typing in that pane),
    "mid-turn" (its agent is working), "behind" (`n` messages ahead of it),
    "starting", "settling", "not-ready", "gone", "paused" or "remote-ack". Both
    keys are absent once the message settles, and while no window has reported
    a hold at all — a message queued with no hold is simply on its way in.

    `stale` is true once a queued message has been waiting more than two
    minutes. It is not a failure and nothing has given up on it — it is the
    point at which waiting longer is probably not the answer, so read `hold`
    and decide whether to wait, address someone else, or tell the user.

    Bounds: this is in-memory backend state, not a log. It is lost on backend
    restart, keeps only the last hour, and only the most recent few hundred
    sends — an unknown `msg_key` means "not tracked any more", not "never

    The mirror of cli_inbox_summary, which asks only about what you sent. This
    asks what is queued for you and has not gone in yet — which, while you are
    working, is everything anyone has sent you: a message is typed into a pane
    only between turns, so an agent that stays busy is precisely the one that
    cannot be told. Until this existed there was no way to find out; the queue
    lives in the receiving window, and nothing offered the recipient's view of
    it.

    Call it between pieces of your own work when something may be waiting on
    you — after dispatching a task with cli_open_agent, or during a long run
    someone might need to interrupt. A non-empty answer is grounds to wrap up
    the turn you are in, which is what lets the message land.

    `excerpt` is 200 characters with the whitespace flattened: enough to tell
    what a message is about, not enough to act on. cli_read_incoming returns
    what was actually written, and can take a message off the queue so it is
    not typed in afterwards.

    Returns {ok, count, messages: [{uid, sender, status, age_seconds, kind?,
    excerpt, correlation_id?, in_reply_to?, hold?, held_for_s?, stale?}]},
    oldest first. `status` is "queued" (waiting for you to be between turns) or
    "delivering" (going in right now). `kind` marks a message Navide wrote
    rather than an agent: "notice" is delivery feedback about your own send,
    "fallback" is a spawned pane's turn forwarded because it ended without
    writing a report.

    `correlation_id` is the one string you and the sender both know this
    message by — the sender's `msg_key`. Pass it to cli_send's `reply_to` to
    answer this message rather than start a new thread. `in_reply_to` is the
    `uid` of the message THIS one answers, when it is itself a reply. Both are
    absent for a message between two panes of a single window: that message is
    never routed, so no such id is ever minted, and the two of you already
    share this `uid`.

    `hold` says why your queue is not moving — {key, n?}, the same reason the
    sender reads from cli_check_message, with `held_for_s` and `stale` (waiting
    over two minutes) beside it. "mid-turn" is you: the message goes in when
    you finish this turn. "typing" is a human at that keyboard, "paused" is
    delivery switched off in that window, and "behind" means `n` messages are
    ahead of this one. It is absent unless this backend dispatched the message
    and the owning window has reported a hold for it — so absence means
    "nothing recorded", not "nothing is holding it". For the live queue state
    of a message this cannot explain, read it with cli_read_incoming
    (`peek: true` leaves delivery alone), which asks the window that owns the
    queue instead of this log.

    Read from the persisted message log, so unlike cli_inbox_summary this
    survives a backend restart. Two limits are worth knowing: the log is
    written by the receiving window a moment after a message is queued, so
    something sent in the last second may not be listed yet; and messages are
    matched by your current messaging name, so anything queued for a name you
    have since been renamed away from is not yours to see. An empty list means
    nothing is waiting — it never means nothing was sent.

    cli_pending_incoming tells you a message exists and shows 200 characters
    of it with the whitespace flattened. This returns what was actually
    written. Until it existed you could read another pane's entire log but not
    one message addressed to yourself.

    BY DEFAULT READING CONSUMES. A message you read here is not typed into
    your input box afterwards — you have it, so delivering it again would
    repeat it. Pass `peek: true` to read without consuming, which leaves
    delivery exactly as it was.

    `uid` reads one message (the uid comes from cli_pending_incoming);
    omitting it reads the oldest `limit` waiting for you. `include_delivered`
    also returns messages already typed into your pane, for looking back at
    what someone said — those are never consumed, because they already were.

    Consuming is two steps, and the failure mode is deliberate: the message is
    reserved, handed to you, and only then released. If the release is lost
    the reservation expires and the message goes BACK to the queue, so it may
    reach you a second time. That is the safe direction — a duplicate is
    visible and a loss is not. Treat a message you have already handled as
    something to recognise, not something that cannot arrive twice.

    Returns {ok, count, messages: [{uid, sender, status, kind?, content,
    age_seconds, consumed, correlation_id?, in_reply_to?, hold?, held_for_s?,
    stale?}]}. `consumed` is per message and is false when the read was a peek,
    when the message was already delivered, or when the window could not be
    reached to release the reservation — in that last case you have the text
    but delivery was left alone, so expect it in your pane.

    `correlation_id` is the one string you and the sender both know this
    message by. Pass it to cli_send's `reply_to` and your answer lands ON this
    message instead of starting a new thread — the same thing an envelope typed
    into your pane asks for with its `re:` field, which until now was the only
    way to reply to a specific message. `in_reply_to` is the `uid` of the
    message THIS one answers, when it is itself a reply. Both are absent for a
    message between two panes of a single window: nothing routes it, so no such
    id exists, and you and the sender already share this `uid`.

    `hold` is why the message had not been typed in yet — {key, n?}: "mid-turn"
    (you are working; it goes in when this turn ends), "typing" (a human at
    that keyboard), "behind" (`n` messages ahead of it), "paused" (delivery
    switched off in that window), "starting", "settling", "not-ready", "gone"
    or "remote-ack". `held_for_s` and `stale` (waiting over two minutes) come
    with it when this backend dispatched the message. Absent means nothing is
    holding it, not that nothing is known — and note that a read of your own
    reserves what it returns, so a hold you read here is the state BEFORE that.

    Only a Navide CLI pane has an inbox. Messages are matched by your current

# ── Reading a pane on ANOTHER machine ──────────────────────────────────────
# The observing tools answer for a remote pane out of `remote_roster`, which is
# Navide-Server's session directory as this machine last received it. Nothing
# new is uploaded for them: cli_list_targets already hands `busy` / `offline` /
# `host_online` / `status` back for every remote pane.
#
# It is a genuinely weaker source than the local path, and every tool below
# says so in its own docstring. The three ways it is weaker, once:
#
#   1. ONE WORD PER PANE. The roster carries the sending window's own sidebar
#      badge (server_link._pane_status) and nothing else — no turn_complete, no
#      last_activity, no log. "The turn ended" is never observed remotely; the
#      most that can be seen is that the pane stopped being busy.
#   2. NO `awaitingKind`. The local path splits "awaiting" into a permission
#      prompt (parked on a HUMAN) and an open question (which counts as idle,
#      see _ui_status_is_idle). The far side sends one word for both, so that
#      split cannot be made here at all.
#   3. IT ARRIVES LATE. The owning window debounces its uploads
#      (server_link.ROSTER_DEBOUNCE_S, 0.5s) and re-sweeps every
#      ROSTER_SWEEP_S (30s), so a status read here is near-live, not live.

#: Roster words that end a wait as "this pane is not working". "idle" is the
#: badge of a pane sitting at its prompt; the other three are terminal — the
#: session is over — and the local path settles on those too
#: (_UI_IDLE_STATUSES), so a remote pane that died ends a wait rather than
#: running it out.
_ROSTER_IDLE_STATUSES = frozenset({"idle", "exited", "stopped", "error"})

#: Roster words that mean the pane is doing something. Deliberately a closed
#: list rather than "anything that is not idle": "waiting" is what a machine too
#: old to send a badge word reports for every pane whatever it is doing, and a
#: word this build has never heard of says nothing at all. Neither may be read
#: as "your message started a turn", so both stay outside this set and leave the
#: wait running. "awaiting" is inside it — the pane is parked, which is
#: something it started doing — but it is not in _ROSTER_IDLE_STATUSES, so it
#: never ends a wait either (see weakness 2 above).

    Settles on four answers instead of the local five:

      - `source: "roster_status"`, idle true — the far window's badge says the

      - `source: "roster_offline"`, idle false, `reason: "offline"` — the far
        machine is away or its window disconnected. Deliberately its own
        answer: it is neither busy nor idle, and the roster keeps the pane
        listed while it is gone, so "no answer" and "not working" would
        otherwise look the same. Returned as soon as it is seen rather than
        waited out — a window that is not there cannot report a turn ending.

    """Block until a CLI pane goes idle, or a timeout passes.

    `target` uses the same addressing as cli_send, and `pane_id` names one
    exact pane instead. `timeout_s` is capped at
    120s. Three signals settle it, in the order they become available: the
    pane's last activity was a turn_complete (aider/antigravity/claude/codex/
    copilot/cursor/kilo/muse/opencode report one directly, so detection is
    precise for them; grok/kimi/pi/qwen synthesize one from 8s of silence, so
    theirs is already an inference); at least 10s of silence
    passed since its last activity; or, while the registry still reports busy,
    the owning window reports the pane itself as idle/exited/stopped/error.
    That last one matters because the busy flag is frontend-reported and can
    stay stale. Returns {idle, source, waited_s, last_activity?, ui_status?}
    where source is "turn_complete", "quiet_period", "ui_status",
    "never_started", or "timeout"; or {ok: false, error} if `target` cannot be
    resolved.

    `last_activity` is what cli_get_status reports under the same key — {type,
    text? (turn_complete only), age_seconds} — so a caller that waited for a
    turn to end also gets what the turn said, without a second call. It is
    absent for a pane whose CLI records no activity at all. `ui_status` is the
    owning window's own word for the pane, present only when a probe reached
    it during the wait.

    "never_started" is idle in the sense that nothing is running, but the pane
    has shown no activity at all — a CLI that finished booting and is sitting
    at its prompt. If you just gave it a task, that task has not begun yet;
    keep waiting rather than treating it as done.

    On timeout the result also carries `reason`, which separates three very
    different failures: "awaiting" (the pane is parked on a permission prompt
    and is waiting on a HUMAN, not on work — answer it in the UI), "busy" (it
    really is still working; wait longer), and "unreachable" (the window that
    owns the pane stopped answering, so nothing here is current).

    A `<device>/<workspace>/<pane>` target is waited on through Navide-Server's
    session directory, and that wait is WEAKER than this one — read `source`,
    which never says "turn_complete" for a remote pane because no end-of-turn
    signal crosses the link. It settles as "roster_status" (the far window's
    badge stopped saying the pane was working), "roster_offline" (that machine
    or its window went away — a third answer, neither busy nor idle), or
    "timeout" with `reason` "busy" or "awaiting_unclassified" — the latter
    meaning the pane is parked and the roster does not carry the
    `awaitingKind` that would say whether it is stuck on a human or merely
    asking a question. There is no `last_activity` and no `ui_status`; the
    badge word is reported as `status`, and it is what the far window last
    uploaded (it debounces by 0.5s and re-sweeps every 30s), so it is near-live
    rather than live.

    This presses that CLI's interrupt key in its terminal — Ctrl-C for most
    vendors, Esc for codex — exactly what the pane's own stop button does. It
    is the middle rung: cli_send asks and waits for the current turn to finish,
    ui_invoke "ui.pane.close" takes the pane and its PTY away, and until now
    there was nothing in between.

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It sends a keystroke; it does not stop a turn. What
    the CLI makes of that keystroke is the CLI's business — most abort the
    running turn, some only clear the text sitting in the input box, and one
    already at an idle prompt may take a second press as "quit" and exit.
    Nothing here waits for a stop or verifies that one happened, so a result
    with `sent: true` means the bytes were written and nothing more. Check with
    cli_get_status or cli_wait_idle if you need to know, and prefer cli_send
    whenever the work can be allowed to finish.

    Interrupting an idle pane is NOT refused — clearing whatever is in its
    input box is a real reason to want it — but it is reported rather than
    passed off as a stop: `status_before` is the pane's status at the instant
    the key went in, and `advisories` says when no turn was interrupted (and
    that a line somebody had typed but not sent may be gone with it).

    `target` uses the same addressing as cli_send and `pane_id` names one exact
    pane instead. Panes on this machine only: an interrupt is a byte written
    into a local PTY and there is no relay for it, so a
    `<device>/<workspace>/<pane>` address fails with "interrupt-local-only" —
    that is a limit of this tool, not a wrong address.

    Returns {ok, target, name, sent, status_before, advisories?}. `sent` false
    means the interrupt was never issued — no live CLI behind the pane (a
    cold-restore placeholder, or one whose session is gone), or the owning
    window's own socket was down, in which case it drops the request rather
    than queueing a stop for whatever turn is running after it reconnects.
    `sent` true means the keystroke was issued and accepted; it is not a
    receipt from the CLI, and a PTY write that fails on the far side is logged
    there rather than reported here.

    """Send an instruction to another CLI pane and wait for it to finish it.

    cli_send followed by cli_wait_idle, with the race between them handled:
    the target is idle at the moment you send, so a plain wait would return
    "already idle" before it ever read your message. This one waits for the
    message to actually GO IN first, then remembers the target's last activity
    before sending and only accepts a turn NEWER than that as your answer.

    `to`, `text`, `pane_id`, `reply_to` and addressing are cli_send's — an id
    given here addresses both halves, the send and the wait. Answering a
    question with this tool is the case `reply_to` exists for, so it threads
    the same way a plain send does. `timeout_s` (capped at 120s)
    covers the whole thing, not just the wait: at most half of it is spent
    getting the message in, and whatever is left waits for the turn.

    On success returns cli_wait_idle's result — {idle: true, source, waited_s,
    last_activity?, ui_status?} — plus {ok: true, target, msg_key}.
    `last_activity.text` is what the other agent said, when its CLI records
    that. ALWAYS read `source`, because it says how much the "finished" is
    worth:

      - "turn_complete" — the CLI reported the turn ended. Trustworthy.
        aider/antigravity/claude/codex/copilot/cursor/kilo/muse/opencode report
        it directly; grok/kimi/pi/qwen infer it from 8s of silence, so it is a
        heuristic for them and a long pause mid-turn can end the wait early.
      - "quiet_period" — no end-of-turn signal ever arrived, the pane just
        went quiet. This is the only outcome available for a plain terminal
        pane, and the fallback whenever a turn ends without its reader
        recording one. Treat it as a guess and check the content.
      - "ui_status" — the owning window reports the pane idle.
      - "target_lost" — the target stopped being addressable during the wait
        (its window closed, the pane was killed), so the wait could not
        finish. The send still happened and `msg_key` is still valid; this is
        "delivered, but I can no longer confirm it was finished", NOT a failed
        send — do not resend on it. `error` carries the resolve failure.
      - "not_delivered" — the message never got into the pane, so there was no
        turn to wait for. `delivery_status` is "queued" (still waiting, with
        `hold` and `held_for_s` saying what for — typically someone typing in
        that pane, or a queue ahead of it), or "failed"/"rejected" with
        `reason`. A queued message is not lost: it goes in when the pane frees
        up, and cli_check_message picks the story up. Do NOT resend on this.

    On timeout returns {ok: true, idle: false, source: "timeout", reason,
    ...}: `reason` is cli_wait_idle's ("awaiting" / "busy" / "unreachable"),
    or "never_started" when the target stayed idle and never showed any sign
    of having read the message. `reason` is only meaningful for "timeout" and
    is absent from every other source. A send that is refused outright returns
    cli_send's {ok: false, error} unchanged.

    A `<device>/<workspace>/<pane>` target works end to end, and `source` is
    where you see what it cost. It is NEVER "turn_complete" for a remote pane
    — no end-of-turn signal crosses the link — and instead settles as
    "roster_status" (Navide-Server's session directory stopped reporting the
    pane as working, which is the strongest thing observable from here),
    "roster_offline" (the far machine or its window went away mid-wait: a
    third answer, neither busy nor idle), or "timeout" with `reason` "busy",
    "never_started", or "awaiting_unclassified" — that last one meaning the
    pane is parked and the roster carries no `awaitingKind`, so whether it is
    stuck on a human or merely asking a question could not be told apart. Nor
    is there a `last_activity`: what the other agent said cannot be read back
    from here, only that it appears to have stopped. "not_delivered" reaches
    remote targets too, and there `reason` is the far device's own ack —
    "rejected" meaning its pane policy refused, which resending will not fix.

    preview_show pushes to it, and until now nothing could take anything off
    it. Use it when the feed is stale enough to mislead — a finished task's
    churn sitting above what the user is about to review.

    This deletes rows the user can see in the Preview panel and cannot be
    undone. Everything on the feed goes, not only your own records: the file
    watcher's and the user's are on it too, so prefer `before` over a full
    clear whenever the point is "drop what is already dealt with".

    before is a created_at timestamp from preview_list (epoch milliseconds):
    rows stamped BEFORE it go and everything at or after it stays, which is
    what makes clearing safe while other sessions are still recording. Left at
    0 the whole feed is cleared.

    Returns {workspace_path, removed, before}; `removed` is how many rows went,
    0 when the feed was already empty. A "warning" field means no live Navide
    pane uses workspace_path, so this cleared a feed the user is not watching.

    another project's feed.

    starts, stops or advances a run.

    `op` selects the operation and decides which other arguments are required:

    - "create"        — needs `name`. Adds an empty pipeline (no stages) and
                        returns it with its generated id. It is not made

                        with op "upsert" to give it stages — a pipeline with no
                        stages cannot be run.
    - "rename"        — needs `pipeline_id` and `name`. Renames in place; ids
                        and stages are untouched.
    - "delete"        — needs `pipeline_id`. DESTRUCTIVE, see below.
    - "set_active"    — needs `pipeline_id`. Selects the template the Pipelines
                        window shows and that pipeline_start uses when called
                        with no pipeline_id of its own.
    - "reset_builtin" — needs `pipeline_id`, and only "default" or
                        "maintenance" have seed data. DESTRUCTIVE, see below.

    `workspace_path` names the project whose run the guards check; it defaults
    to your own pane's workspace, and a caller with no pane that passes nothing
    gets no guard at all. Pass it when editing on behalf of another project.

    What the destructive ops actually do to a run in progress:

    - "delete" and "set_active" are REFUSED outright while that workspace has
      a run in the running state (error_code "pipeline_running"). Abort the run
      first if you mean it.
    - "reset_builtin" replaces every stage of the pipeline with its seed set,
      and is refused while the run in progress is using that pipeline — a run
      records which pipeline it belongs to, and naming it explicitly does not
      get past the guard.
    - A deleted pipeline does not stop or rewind a run that was already
      started: the run keeps its own recorded pipeline_id and the panes it has
      already opened. What breaks is resuming it later, since the template it
      names is gone. The last remaining pipeline cannot be deleted at all.
    - Nothing here touches a run's recorded progress. Editing a template while
      an unrelated workspace runs a different one is fine.

    A stage is one step of a pipeline and holds the slots that become panes:
    each slot names a CLI (agent_key) and a role (role_key) and carries the
    kickoff text that pane is started with. pipeline_list shows the current
    shape of every pipeline; this changes it.

    `op` selects the operation and decides which other arguments are required:

    - "upsert"  — needs `stage`, a full stage object. Matched by `stage["id"]`:
                  an existing id is merged over (fields you omit keep their old
                  values), a new one is appended at the end. The store requires
                  `id` (alphanumeric, hyphen, underscore and dot only) and a
                  non-empty `slots` list. A stage looks like
                  {id, title, short_title, question, description, sentinel,
                  recommended_roles, allow_questions, doc_query, slots}, and
                  each slot {agent_key, role_key, label, kickoff_body,
                  is_commander}. Read one out of pipeline_list first and edit
                  that shape rather than composing one blind — but note
                  pipeline_list deliberately omits kickoff_body, so an upsert
                  built from it alone would blank the kickoffs of the slots it
                  rewrites.
    - "delete"  — needs `stage_id`. Refused for the last remaining stage of a
                  pipeline.
    - "reorder" — needs `ids`, the stage ids in the order you want. Ids not
                  listed keep their relative order at the end, unknown ids and
                  duplicates are ignored. The order IS the run order.
    - "reset"   — takes no extra argument. DESTRUCTIVE, see below.

    `pipeline_id` picks which pipeline to edit; left empty it means the active
    one, which is what the Pipelines window has selected and not necessarily
    the one you were reading. Name it.

    `workspace_path` names the project whose run the guard checks; it defaults
    to your own pane's workspace.

    What this does to a run in progress: EVERY op here is refused while the
    workspace has a run using this pipeline (error_code "pipeline_running") —
    a run compares against the pipeline it recorded at start, so naming that
    pipeline explicitly does not slip past. That is the whole protection: a
    stage list edited mid-run would change the flow underneath the run. Runs in
    other workspaces, or on other pipelines, are unaffected — and an edit
    landing between two runs changes what the NEXT one does, silently, which is
    the case to warn the user about.

    "reset" throws away every stage of the pipeline and puts back the seed set:
    the built-in stages for "default" and "maintenance", and NOTHING AT ALL for
    a pipeline you created — a custom pipeline reset this way is left empty and
    unrunnable, and there is no undo. Read it out of pipeline_list first if you
    might want it back.

    Returns {ok, op, stages, pipeline_id, pipelines, active_pipeline_id}, plus
    `stage` for "upsert". ok false carries `error` and `error_code` — one of
    "bad_op", "missing_argument", "pipeline_running", "not_found", "invalid" —

    A role is a named system prompt: a stage slot names one by `role_key`, and
    the pane that slot opens is started with that role's prompt. Roles are
    global to the machine, not per pipeline and not per workspace, so an edit
    here reaches every pipeline that names the role. pipeline_list lists the
    roles that exist (key, label, one_line) but never their prompt bodies.

    `op` selects the operation and decides which other arguments are required:

    - "upsert" — needs `key`, `label` and `system_prompt`; `one_line` is the
                 short description shown next to the label. An existing key is
                 overwritten, a new one created. `key` must be lowercase
                 letters, digits, underscore or dash, 1-32 characters.
                 REPLACES the whole role: label and system_prompt you do not
                 pass are not kept, they are written blank — and blank is
                 refused, which is the only thing stopping a partial upsert
                 from erasing a prompt.
    - "rename" — needs `key` (the current one) and `new_key`. Renames in one
                 step and repoints every stage slot that named the old key, so
                 there is no intermediate state where slots point at nothing.
                 `label` / `one_line` / `system_prompt` are optional here: what
                 you omit is carried over from the existing role. Refused if
                 `key` does not exist, or if `new_key` is already taken —
                 merging two roles would silently drop one side's prompt.
    - "delete" — needs `key`. REFUSED while any stage slot still names the
                 role, and the refusal lists those slots in `usages` so you can
                 repoint them (stage_define op "upsert") or rename instead. A
                 slot pointing at a deleted role fails role injection and
                 leaves that stage's pane sitting at an empty prompt with
                 nothing on screen to say why — which is what the refusal is
                 for. The last remaining role cannot be deleted at all.
    - "reset"  — takes no extra argument. DESTRUCTIVE: throws away every role,
                 custom ones included, and puts back the built-in set. Slots
                 left naming a role the seed set does not have are then blanked
                 rather than left dangling, so pipelines survive but those
                 slots lose their role and must be re-cast. There is no undo.

    Roles have no run guard: unlike stages, editing one is allowed while a
    pipeline runs. A pane already started keeps the prompt it was given — the
    change reaches the next pane opened for that slot, not the ones on screen.

# leaves ui.settings.yolo out of WORKSPACE_SCOPED_ACTIONS — a window answers it

# for a global setting to land in. workspace_path here only picks the window.

    "Yolo" is Navide's name for the permission-bypass flag it passes a CLI at
    spawn (claude's --dangerously-skip-permissions and each vendor's
    equivalent). It is ONE setting for the whole app — not per workspace, not
    per pipeline, not per pane — stored with the user's settings and read by
    every path that starts a CLI: new panes, pipeline slots, resumes and
    restores alike.

    Called with no argument it only reads. Passing `yolo` sets it, and the new
    value applies to CLIs started AFTER the change; processes already running
    keep the flags they were launched with, so turning it off does not reach
    back into a pane that is already going.

    WHAT TURNING IT ON MEANS: the CLIs Navide starts stop asking before they
    edit files, run shell commands or make network calls in the user's
    workspace, and act on their own judgement instead. That is the user's
    call to make. Do not switch it on to get your own work past a prompt.

    Returns {ok, result, error}; `result` is {yolo, agents}. `yolo` is the
    global switch. `agents` is one entry per CLI vendor — {agent, mode,
    skipFlag} — and it is the half that actually answers "will this CLI skip
    its prompts":

    - `mode` is that vendor's own override and BEATS the global switch:
      "inherit" follows it, "force-on" and "force-off" ignore it. So `yolo`
      true on its own does not mean every CLI bypasses, and `yolo` false does
      not mean none does — reading only the switch will mislead you.
    - `skipFlag` is the flag that vendor would actually be launched with right
      now, and empty string means none. Vendors with no bypass flag at all
      (grok, opencode, pi) are always empty here whatever the switch says.

    Read `agents[].skipFlag` for the per-CLI answer; `yolo` is only the default
    the ones on "inherit" fall back to.

    `workspace_path` is ADDRESSING ONLY — it picks which window is asked, not
    what the change applies to. The setting is one global value whichever
    window reads or writes it, so every window gives the same answer and a
    write through any of them reaches all of them. It defaults to your own
    pane's window, and a caller with no pane that names nothing simply gets
    whichever window is open. There is no per-project version of this setting
    to reach by passing a different path.

    ok false with error_code "ui_no_window" means no Navide window was open to
    ask.

# ── Resources: the same read-only surfaces, addressed by URI ────────────────
# An MCP client lists and reads resources on the user's behalf — attaching one
# to a conversation is something they do, not something an agent is talked
# into. So these three are strictly read-only, and each is a view of data a
# tool already serves rather than a second implementation of it.
#
# The credential is not injected here. A resource function that declares a
# Context parameter and NO uri parameter is registered by the SDK as a
# *template* (the decorator branches on "has any parameters", not on "has uri
# parameters"), and a template with no parameters never matches its own uri:
# its matcher hands back an empty parameter dict, which the resource manager
# reads as "no match" — the resource becomes unreadable, with "Unknown
# resource" as the only symptom. So a parameterless resource takes its context
# from :meth:`FastMCP.get_context` instead, which returns the very object the
# decorator would have injected; the templated one, which has a uri parameter,
# takes the injected Context. Both reach the same authenticated HTTP request,
# so `_resolve_caller` applies to a resource read exactly as it does to a tool
# call, and an unwired caller is refused the same way.
