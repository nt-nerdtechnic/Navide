"""Plan MCP server — plan-document tools over streamable HTTP.

Mounted on the backend's FastAPI app in the same process (later phases must
reach in-process singletons like TerminalService, so no stdio subprocess).
The backend has no single "current workspace" — every ws_handler receives
``workspace_path`` per request from the client — so the MCP tools follow the
same convention and take ``workspace_path`` as a call-time argument. A caller
authenticated as a pane may omit it: the tools then use that pane's own
workspace, which is the value Navide's plan window resolves plans against, so
a plan cannot land where the window will not look for it (see
:func:`_caller_workspace`).

Path safety reuses :func:`fs_service._resolve_safe` (the same guard the fs.*
handlers use), plus a plans-subtree containment check on top.

Lifecycle: the SDK's ``StreamableHTTPSessionManager.run()`` is once-only per
instance, so instead of ``FastMCP.streamable_http_app()`` (which caches one
manager forever) this module exposes a thin ASGI endpoint that delegates to
the manager created by the latest :func:`startup` call. ``startup`` /
``shutdown`` are registered as plugin lifecycle hooks (see backend.py) and run
from app.py's startup/shutdown events, which Starlette runs in the same
lifespan task — safe for the anyio task group inside.

    This is who exists, not who is related to you — the list carries no
    lineage. The panes you opened with cli_open_agent are yours to keep track
    of; that record lives in your own context, not in this answer. Refer to
    them however reads naturally when talking to the user; the word does not
    matter, remembering who you opened does.

    `pane_id` is that pane's internal id. It is the key every `ui.pane.*` action
    takes (`ui.pane.close`, `ui.pane.focus`, `ui.pane.getStatus` via ui_invoke)
    — those reject a pane NAME — and it is also accepted by cli_send,

    the pane being rebuilt. Reach for `pane_id` when an address cannot say
    which pane you mean — two targets below with the SAME address are two panes
    sharing a name, and every one of those tools refuses that address as
    "ambiguous-target" rather than guessing between them. Remote targets have no
    local id and carry none, so they can only be addressed by name.

    `offline` marks a pane whose Navide window has lost its connection: it still
    exists and is expected back, but sending to it fails until it returns.

    `hold_reason` appears on a target that has a cli_send message still waiting
    to go in, and names what is holding it ("typing", "mid-turn", "starting",
    "behind", …). It is the same reason the Messages panel shows, and it is
    what makes `busy` explainable — but it exists only while a message sent
    from here is queued for that pane, so its absence says nothing.

    `remote_targets` appears only when this machine is linked to a Navide-Server
    and that server knows of panes on *other* machines. Those are a separate
    list because they are a separate deal: their `address` is the three-part
    `<device>/<workspace>/<pane>` form, the message travels through the server
    (so it can fail in ways a local one cannot — the far machine may be offline,
    or refuse on policy grounds), and there is no reading their output from
    here. Each carries `device` (the machine's human-readable label, or its id
    when the server knows no name), `host_online` (that whole machine is
    reachable) and `status` (the server's own word for the pane). `offline` is
    true when either half says the message would not land right now. Prefer a

    it with cli_get_status: `ui.kickoff` is "sent" when the task was observed
    landing, "unverified" when the bytes were written but the only echo was a
    booting CLI repainting (read `ui.buffer`; re-send with cli_send if the
    prompt is empty), or "failed". A failure is ALSO reported by message to a
    pane caller — but only to a pane caller, and only when the injection
    reported failure, which is exactly the case "unverified" exists to cover. For a pane caller, the new pane is asked to report its
    result to you by message when it finishes — but that report is the child
    agent's own output, not a guarantee from Navide: it is held until you are
    between turns, and nothing arrives if the child never writes the block.
    Poll cli_get_status / cli_wait_idle whenever you need to be sure. An
    external or host caller gets no such message at all and must poll.

    Use the returned name, not the one you asked for: a concurrent request may
    have taken that name, in which case yours gets a suffix.

    Refused when the name is taken, the agent key is unknown, or the task is
    empty. A high child/workspace/depth count never refuses the spawn — it
    just gets logged as a diagnostic warning and, on success, also returned
    here as `advisories` (a list of human-readable notes; the key is absent
    when there is nothing to report).
    Returns {ok, name, address, advisories?} or {ok: false, error}.

    """Send an instruction to another CLI pane, in this or another workspace.

    `to` is a pane name for a pane in your own workspace, or `<folder>/<pane>`
    for one in another workspace window — cli_list_targets shows both forms. A
    caller with no pane identity (host / external credential) has no "own
    workspace" and must always use the qualified `<folder>/<pane>` form. The
    text is delivered verbatim and submitted for the receiving agent to act on,
    once that pane is idle; it is queued if the pane is mid-turn. An unknown or
    ambiguous target is refused rather than guessed.

    `to: "group"` broadcasts instead: every other pane in YOUR OWN tab group,
    in your own workspace. Deliberately narrower than the bare-line protocol's
    `all`, which means every pane in the window regardless of group. Panes in no
    group share one implicit group, so they reach each other rather than nobody.
    A caller with no pane identity has no group and is refused ("no-group").
    The answer is a different shape — {ok, broadcast, group_id, delivered_to,
    recipients: [{name, pane_id, msg_key, accepted, reason?}]} — with ONE
    msg_key per recipient, because each is an ordinary independent message:
    its own rate-limit budget, its own idle hold, its own delivery report. Pass
    each key to cli_check_message separately; `wait_for_delivery_s` does not
    apply to a broadcast and is ignored. An empty `recipients` means your group
    has nobody else in it — not a failure.

    `pane_id` addresses one exact pane and makes `to` unnecessary — copy it from
    cli_list_targets. Reach for it when a name cannot say which pane you mean:
    two panes in one workspace may share a name, and that is refused as
    "ambiguous-target" however the name is spelled. It also survives a rename.
    It names a pane on this machine only, so a cross-device target must still be
    addressed by name. An id follows its pane through a window reload or a
    detach, but a pane restarted around a fresh CLI gets a new one — treat
    "unknown-pane-id" as "read a fresh id from cli_list_targets", not as "that
    pane is gone".

    Delivery is asynchronous: this returns once the message is accepted for
    delivery, not once the other agent has read it. Returns
    {ok, target, cross_workspace, msg_key} or {ok: false, error, error_code}.
    Pass `msg_key` to cli_check_message to learn whether the receiving window
    actually delivered it.

    `wait_for_delivery_s` (0 by default, capped at 120) is the alternative to
    remembering to poll: wait that long for the message to actually go in, and
    answer with what happened. 10-30s is the useful range — the wait costs your
    own turn, and a pane that is mid-turn or being typed in can hold a message
    far longer than that. With it set, the answer also carries:

      - `status: "delivered"` and `settled_after_s` — it went in.
      - `status: "failed"` (or "rejected" for another device) and `reason` —
        the receiving window refused it. `ok` stays TRUE: the send itself
        happened and `msg_key` is real, so re-sending on this would dispatch
        the work twice. Read the reason and decide.
      - `status: "queued"` with `waited_s`, plus `hold` and `held_for_s` when
        the receiving window said why — the message is still waiting. `hold.key`
        is "typing" (someone is at that keyboard), "mid-turn" (the agent is
        working), "behind" (other messages first), "starting", "settling",
        "not-ready" or "gone". Nothing was lost; it goes in when the pane frees
        up, and cli_check_message picks the story up later.

    `error_code` "target-offline" is not "unknown-target": the pane exists but
    its Navide window is disconnected. Wait for it to come back and retry —
    re-sending elsewhere or reopening the pane would duplicate the work.

    A `<device>/<workspace>/<pane>` target names a pane on another machine and
    is relayed through the configured Navide-Server. Copy the address from
    cli_list_targets' `remote_targets` rather than assembling it: `device` may
    be either the machine's id or its name, and only the id is guaranteed not
    to collide with one of this machine's own workspace paths. "device-offline"
    means that machine has no connection at all, so waiting is the only option;
    the receiving device may also refuse on policy grounds, which shows up in
    cli_check_message as status "rejected".

    Three error codes tell apart the ways cross-device sending can fail before
    the message even leaves here, and only the first is about the address:
    "unknown-device" (no server is configured on this machine, so no device but
    this one can be named), "link-offline" (a server is configured but this
    machine is not connected to it — the address may be perfectly good) and
    "link-unauthorized" (this machine's server credential was rejected or
    revoked; retrying cannot help until it is signed in again).

    The two link errors also carry ``link_state`` and ``last_error``, and the
    message says what to do: "connecting" is the only one worth retrying,
    "unreachable" means the address is not answering from here, and
    "unauthorized" means somebody has to sign in again. Telling all three to
    retry shortly — which is what this used to do — is advice that works for
    one of them.

    `msg_key` is the value cli_send returned. Returns {ok, msg_key, status,
    target, age_seconds, reason?, settled_after_s?, hold?, held_for_s?,
    stale?}. `status` is one of:

      - "queued"    — broadcast for delivery; no window has reported back yet.
                      A message held for a busy pane stays here until it is
                      actually injected.
      - "delivered" — the receiving window injected and submitted it.
      - "failed"    — the receiving window refused or lost it; see `reason`.
      - "rejected"  — only for a message sent to another device: that device's
                      pane policy refuses this sender. Re-sending refuses
                      again; this is a permission question for a human, not
                      something to retry.

    `reason` values come from the receiving window: "rate-limit" (too many
    messages between the same pair too quickly), "queue-full" (the target's
    pending-message queue is at its cap), "inject-failed" (typing it into the
    pane did not take), "pane-closed" (the target went away before delivery),
    "no-report" (the delivery attempt never reported an outcome).

    On a "queued" message, `hold` is why it has not gone in yet — {key, n?},
    the same reason the Messages panel shows — and `held_for_s` is how long it
    has been that way. `hold.key` is "typing" (someone is typing in that pane),
    "mid-turn" (its agent is working), "behind" (`n` messages ahead of it),
    "starting", "settling", "not-ready", "gone", "paused" or "remote-ack". Both
    keys are absent once the message settles, and while no window has reported
    a hold at all — a message queued with no hold is simply on its way in.

    `stale` is true once a queued message has been waiting more than two
    minutes. It is not a failure and nothing has given up on it — it is the
    point at which waiting longer is probably not the answer, so read `hold`
    and decide whether to wait, address someone else, or tell the user.

    Bounds: this is in-memory backend state, not a log. It is lost on backend
    restart, keeps only the last hour, and only the most recent few hundred
    sends — an unknown `msg_key` means "not tracked any more", not "never
    sent". Returns {ok: false, error} for an unknown key.

    pane's last activity was a turn_complete (aider/antigravity/claude/codex/
    copilot/cursor/kilo/muse/opencode report one directly, so detection is
    precise for them; grok/kimi/pi/qwen synthesize one from 8s of silence, so
    theirs is already an inference); at least 10s of silence
    passed since its last activity; or, while the registry still reports busy,
    the owning window reports the pane itself as idle/exited/stopped/error.
    That last one matters because the busy flag is frontend-reported and can
    stay stale. Returns {idle, source, waited_s, last_activity?, ui_status?}
    where source is "turn_complete", "quiet_period", "ui_status",

    `last_activity` is what cli_get_status reports under the same key — {type,

    turn to end also gets what the turn said, without a second call. It is
    absent for a pane whose CLI records no activity at all. `ui_status` is the
    owning window's own word for the pane, present only when a probe reached
    it during the wait.

    "never_started" is idle in the sense that nothing is running, but the pane
    has shown no activity at all — a CLI that finished booting and is sitting
    at its prompt. If you just gave it a task, that task has not begun yet;
    keep waiting rather than treating it as done.

    On timeout the result also carries `reason`, which separates three very
    different failures: "awaiting" (the pane is parked on a permission prompt
    and is waiting on a HUMAN, not on work — answer it in the UI), "busy" (it

    message to actually GO IN first, then remembers the target's last activity
    before sending and only accepts a turn NEWER than that as your answer.

        aider/antigravity/claude/codex/copilot/cursor/kilo/muse/opencode report
        it directly; grok/kimi/pi/qwen infer it from 8s of silence, so it is a
        heuristic for them and a long pause mid-turn can end the wait early.
      - "quiet_period" — no end-of-turn signal ever arrived, the pane just
        went quiet. This is the only outcome available for a plain terminal
        pane, and the fallback whenever a turn ends without its reader
        recording one. Treat it as a guess and check the content.
      - "ui_status" — the owning window reports the pane idle.
      - "target_lost" — the target stopped being addressable during the wait

        up, and cli_check_message picks the story up. Do NOT resend on this.

    On timeout returns {ok: true, idle: false, source: "timeout", reason,
    ...}: `reason` is cli_wait_idle's ("awaiting" / "busy" / "unreachable"),
    or "never_started" when the target stayed idle and never showed any sign
    of having read the message. `reason` is only meaningful for "timeout" and
