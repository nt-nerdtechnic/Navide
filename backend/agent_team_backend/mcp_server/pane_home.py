"""Per-pane shim homes for the CLIs whose only MCP surface is a home-dir file.

kimi, grok and antigravity have no MCP flag and no variable that carries a
config document, so wiring them means giving each pane its own copy of the
directory holding one. Done naively that logs the user out — their credentials
live in the same tree. So a shim mirrors the real directory by symlink and
materialises *only* the MCP config as a real file: credentials, sessions and
history stay links to the user's own, and writes go straight through to them.

Two shapes, picked by what the CLI offers:

- kimi has a dedicated config-dir variable (``KIMI_CODE_HOME``), so its shim is
  just that directory and ``$HOME`` is left alone.
- grok and antigravity have none (their config root is hardcoded to
  ``Path.home()``), so theirs is a whole HOME shim: the top level of ``$HOME``
  mirrored by symlink with the vendor directory rebuilt inside it. This is the
  shape credential_vault already uses for grok login panes.

grok is the awkward one: its MCP servers and its BYO API key live in the *same*
file (``~/.grok/user-settings.json``), so that file alone cannot be a symlink
and is copied instead. Which copy a spawn builds on is decided by mtime (see
_base_config): a pane that rotated its own key keeps it, and an account switch
reaches the pane on its next spawn but never one already running. Its OAuth
credential is a separate file and stays linked, so this affects the BYO key and
preferences only.

Every failure here is non-fatal: prepare() returns None and the pane spawns
unwired rather than not at all.
