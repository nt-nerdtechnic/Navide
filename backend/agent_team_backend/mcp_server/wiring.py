"""Wire pane CLI agents to the Plan MCP endpoint.

The backend serves a Plan MCP server at ``/plan-mcp`` (see plan_mcp.py) on a
dynamic port picked fresh each launch, so nothing static can point at it.
Merge-writing user-owned config files was rejected as clobber-prone:
``~/.claude.json`` is rewritten wholesale by a running claude CLI (a
read-modify-write from us can lose its update, and vice versa) and
``~/.codex/config.toml`` is user-global and shared into every per-pane
CODEX_HOME via symlink. Instead, terminal.create uses whatever additive,
CLI-native spawn-time surface each CLI offers.

Which surface a CLI offers, the flag it spells it with and the config
vocabulary it reads are that CLI's own business and are declared by its module
in ``cli_vendors`` (``VendorSpec.mcp_wiring``); this module knows only the four
mechanisms and does the I/O:

- a spawn-time FLAG carrying the config (claude, copilot, qwen) or a one-shot
  config override (codex). Additive by construction: servers passed this way
  load in addition to the user's own, and a command that already carries the
  flag — ours from an earlier pass, or the user's deliberate MCP setup — is
  left exactly as it is. claude is additionally the one whose flag takes a
  path, so a spawn with no pane id (and therefore no pane-specific URL) is
  handed the app-owned ``<app_data_dir>/plan-mcp.json`` instead of an inline
  document, which is why that file is still written at startup.
- an ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE carrying a whole config document (opencode, kilo),
  deep-merged by the CLI over the user's files, so nothing on disk is written
  and the value dies with the pane. A value already present in the spawn env
  is left alone. Note this reaches only variables Navide itself set — one
  exported from the user's shell profile is inherited by the CLI process and
  would be overwritten.
- a PROJECT CONFIG FILE in the workspace (cursor), the one exception to "no
  user config file is ever modified". It is merge-written, and because one
  file is shared by every pane in the workspace it holds a reference to an
  environment variable rather than a URL, with the per-pane credential riding
  in the spawn env. A file we created is added to ``.git/info/exclude`` so it
  stays out of the user's git status; one that already existed is left to the
  user to manage. Unparseable JSON aborts the write rather than clobbering it.
- a CONFIG FILE UNDER THE HOME DIRECTORY and nothing else (kimi, grok,
  antigravity). Each pane gets a shim of that directory — mirrored by symlink
  so credentials and sessions stay the user's, with only the MCP config
  materialised. See pane_home.py.

The port is read from the discovery file written by __main__ before uvicorn
starts (same mechanism the Claude hooks use). File absent → wiring no-ops,
so a spawn is never broken over MCP wiring.
