# echo paid the full batch delay for as long as the user kept typing — the
# window never got a chance to cool down.  Chunk count only means "sustained
# stream" if a chunk is big enough to represent real throughput.
#
# CAVEAT (measured 2026-08-06): on macOS this size is aspirational.  A PTY
# master read returns at most 1024 bytes however much is asked for — a 200 KB

# the event loop — 20 decodes and 20 flush-scheduling rounds for one keystroke.
# _on_readable instead drains until EAGAIN, which collapses those into a single
# callback.  The drain is bounded so a sustained flood still yields to the loop:
# _flush_output's remove_reader backpressure only engages between callbacks, and
# an unbounded loop would starve every other session.  256 KB is an order of
# magnitude above one repaint and well under _BUF_CAP.
_READ_DRAIN_MAX_BYTES = 256 * 1024

# the full batch window makes typing feel laggy (worst for IME input, where the

# _FAST_PATH_MAX_BYTES within _FAST_PATH_WINDOW_S, flush on the next loop tick
# instead.  Sustained streams exceed the threshold and fall back to
# _OUTPUT_BATCH_MS batching, so the flood protection above still holds.
#
# The gate is BYTES, not chunk count.  Counting chunks conflated "many small
# reads" with "high throughput": a CLI that wakes the reader often — repainting
# a spinner, or splitting one repaint across reads — looked like a stream and
# pushed the typist onto the 50ms path even though the actual data rate was
# trivial.  _READ_CHUNK_BYTES above already made one repaint one chunk for the
# well-behaved CLIs; the byte gate covers the ones it didn't.
# 192KB/0.1s ~= 1.9MB/s: an order of magnitude above per-keystroke repaint

# tick (0ms) sounds like the lowest-latency choice, but because macOS caps a
# PTY read at 1024 bytes (see _READ_CHUNK_BYTES), one 20 KB repaint arrives as
# ~20 reads and each got its own flush — 20 WebSocket frames per keystroke,
# every one of them paying a remove_reader/send/add_reader cycle that stops
# draining the PTY while it sends, and costing the renderer 20 parses and 20
# xterm writes.  Waiting 2ms lets a whole repaint land in one flush.
#
# Measured (20 KB-per-keystroke TUI, 60 keystrokes, same round):
#   0ms: p50 7.6ms, p95 34.7ms, 20 frames/keystroke
#   2ms: p50 5.4ms, p95 25.1ms,  1 frame/keystroke
# The window pays for itself — the per-frame overhead it removes exceeds the
