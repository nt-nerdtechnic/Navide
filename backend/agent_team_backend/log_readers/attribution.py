"""Attribute CLI log-file token events to Agent-Team workspaces + panes.

Design (B — workspace ↔ CLI folder association):

  1. The user registers a workspace by ever telling Agent-Team about its path
     (project.peek / project.upsert / pipeline.start / terminal.create).
     Each workspace records its expected CLI session folders:
       • Claude  → ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/ (encode_claude_cwd)
       • Codex   → matched by session_meta.cwd at parse time
  2. When a token-usage event arrives, we look up which registered workspace
     the file belongs to. Events outside any registered workspace are dropped
     by the sink layer (workspace_path=None) so "All time" only tracks usage
     in workspaces the user has actually opened in Agent-Team.
  3. Optional pane attribution: within the current run we still know which
     pane spawned which session (for the "By Pane" panel section). This is
     ephemeral — gone after restart, but the workspace mapping persists.

Side effect of the design:
  - Sessions in a workspace folder that the user opens in Claude Code directly
    (without going through Agent-Team) STILL count toward that workspace.
    This matches what the user wants: usage on the project, by any means.
  - Workspace registration persists to disk so historic sessions count from
    the moment a workspace is first opened, including past .jsonl files.

        Handles the preferred non-marker identity path first:
          - Codex: per-pane CODEX_HOME path encodes pane_id; resume id is
            session_meta.payload.id.

        Falls back to marker matching for older sessions and during rollout.
        Antigravity has no identity path at launch (`agy --conversation` can't
        create a chosen id), so it relies on marker matching plus the
        single-candidate new-session fallback; its resume id is the
        conversation .db filename stem (= usage.session_id).
        Kimi likewise can't pin an id (`kimi --session` only resumes); its
        marker is typed into the TUI post-launch and is silently lost when the
        injection loses the startup timing race, so the single-candidate
        fallback is its safety net — resume id is the `session_<uuid>` dir
        name (= usage.session_id).
        Grok relies on markers exclusively, but stores every session in
        one shared SQLite db — its binding queries the db via the reader.
        OpenCode works the same way (`opencode --session <id>` can only
        resume, and all sessions live in one shared db), as does Kilo Code
        (an OpenCode fork — `kilo --session <id>`, shared kilo.db).
        Qwen writes one jsonl per session (like Claude) and preserves user
        text verbatim, so the kickoff marker lands in the session file —
        marker matching plus the single-candidate fallback bind it; the
        resume id is the file stem accepted by `qwen --resume <id>`
        (= usage.session_id).
        Pi likewise writes one jsonl per session and preserves user text
        verbatim, so marker matching plus the single-candidate fallback
        bind it — but the file only appears after the FIRST assistant reply
        completes (lazy flush), so its binding lands later than other
        vendors'. The resume id is the header id `pi --session-id <id>`
        accepts (= usage.session_id; the filename stem carries a timestamp
        prefix and is NOT the id).
        Copilot writes one events.jsonl per session dir and preserves user
        text verbatim (user.message data.content), so the kickoff marker
        lands in the session file — marker matching plus the
        single-candidate fallback bind it; the resume id is the session dir
        name accepted by `copilot --resume=<id>` (= usage.session_id).
        Cursor writes one store.db per session, but its content is opaque
        protobuf blobs, so marker resolution belongs to the reader (a raw
        bytes scan via find_sessions_by_marker) — the same reader-driven
        binding path as the shared-db vendors, even though the dbs are
        per-session; the resume id is the session dir name accepted by
        `agent --resume=<id>`.
        Aider appends every session to ONE per-project Markdown history file
        and preserves user text verbatim (`#### ` lines), so the kickoff
        marker lands in the file — but only the file's LAST started-at
        section is the live session, so marker matching scans just that
        section and there is no single-candidate fallback (the shared file
        usually pre-exists in the pane's baseline). Aider has no session id;
        the announced "resume id" is the section's started-at slug, and
        resume itself is the id-less, lossy `aider --restore-chat-history`.
