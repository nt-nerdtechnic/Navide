    The watcher has no durable mark for a file it is seeing for the first time
    (fresh install, first start after upgrade), so the reader would walk it from
    line 1 — a json.loads per line and one broadcast per entry, measured at
    ~148,000 events in the first 60 seconds of a cold start (GitHub #28).
    Counting newlines reaches the same resume point for a fraction of the cost.

    number, and a reader keyed on db row ids or per-session sequence numbers
    would not consult it. Returns True when a mark was set.

    How far the mark goes depends on how recently the file was written, because
    the cost of guessing wrong is one-directional — a turn skipped here has no
    second chance, since nothing re-reads a line once the mark is past it:

    * Untouched for more than SEED_TAIL_GRACE_S before this process started:
      history only. Marked to the end; nothing is parsed, nothing is broadcast.
    * More recent than that: it may belong to a live pane mid-turn, or hold the
      last turn written before a crash. Marked only up to SEED_TAIL_BYTES from
      the end, so the reader parses that tail and delivers what is in it.

    The tail is what makes the second case affordable. Refusing to mark such a
    file at all — the earlier shape of this function — left the reader walking
    it from line 1, so the busiest, largest transcripts were exactly the ones
    that still replayed in full.

    Counts what the readers count, so the mark means the same thing to them: a
    blank line never advances it, and an unterminated final line is left in
    front of it so the completed line is still delivered on the next poll
    (GitHub #21 — advancing past a half-written turn-end record left the pane

        the ingestion pipeline would double-count history it already holds.

        Same arithmetic and session filter as total_usage_for_session, but it
        reads only the bytes/rows after the cursor and returns the cursor to
        resume from, so a session file that only grows is never re-parsed from
        the top. An empty checkpoint means "the whole source", and the totals
        are then identical to total_usage_for_session's.

        Built on parse_incremental — the same per-vendor primitive the
        ingestion watcher uses — so the live per-session tally reads a file
        exactly the way cumulative/global do. Nothing is recorded or
        checkpointed: the cursor is the caller's private bookkeeping.

        A reader still on parse_incremental's legacy fallback hands back an
        unbounded key set; that form is dropped (empty cursor returned), which
        makes the caller re-read in full next time rather than grow forever.
