"""File-system watcher that polls registered LogReaders for new token events.

Uses `watchdog` for change notifications, with a periodic full-rescan
fallback (default 30s) to recover from missed events (network mounts,
edge-case file ops). Token readers resume from compact per-file checkpoints
owned by TokensStore; the watcher persists its activity dedup marks into the
same store, under the reserved "@activity" scope, so a restart resumes where
the last one stopped instead of replaying every transcript from line 1.

Architecture:

    LogWatcher.start()
        ├─ observer (watchdog Observer) — async file events → enqueue(path)
        ├─ drain loop (asyncio) — immediate session/activity processing
        ├─ rescan loop (asyncio) — every N s → enqueue changed session files
        └─ token loop (asyncio) — every 300s → parse coalesced paths
                                             → emit TokenUsage to sink

The sink callback runs on the asyncio loop. It MUST be fast (just enqueue
to tokens_store + broadcast); long work blocks the drain.

# A file's activity dedup set used to hold one short key per line ever parsed

# they scatter across every pymalloc arena and stop CPython returning any of
# them (an arena is only ever munmap'd once it is completely empty).
# Measured 2026-08-18 on a zero-pane startup scan of 5209 transcripts:
# 452,693 retained keys, ~47 MB of live strings/sets, holding 481 MB of arenas.
# A file that is gone can never be scanned again, so its set is pure garbage.
# A file that still exists keeps its set however old it looks: resuming an old
# session is a first-class flow here, and a resumed transcript with no dedup
# state replays every historical turn — text, turn_complete and all — at a pane
# that is already registered and attributed. (The durable "@activity"
# checkpoint below would rebuild the mark on the next read, but only after the
# file has already been re-enqueued and re-walked; the in-memory bag is what
