"""SQLite persistence for Navide's in-process scheduler.

Two tables in the global ``navide.db``:

- ``scheduler_jobs`` — one row per job. The definition (schedule / action /
  policy) and the runtime ``state`` are stored as separate JSON columns so a
  state write never rewrites what the user configured.
- ``scheduler_runs`` — append-only run history, trimmed to the newest
  :data:`RUNS_PER_JOB` rows of a job on every append.
- ``scheduler_usage`` (schema v3) — dispatched runs of agent-owned jobs per
  local day. Kept apart from the run history because deleting a job deletes
  its runs, which would otherwise let an agent reset its own daily total.

Schema v2 adds ``owner`` (who created the job) and ``updated_by`` (who
last changed it) to ``scheduler_jobs``. Rows that predate v2 — and any written
by a downgraded build, which leaves ``owner`` NULL — read as the user's.

Every public method is a coroutine that runs its SQLite work through
``asyncio.to_thread``: the scheduler lives on the event loop, and a disk stall
there freezes every PTY reader and WebSocket send (the 2026-08-24 typing-latency
incident). The shared :class:`~.db.Database` connection is used as-is — no
second connection — per the single-writer premise in ``db.py``.
