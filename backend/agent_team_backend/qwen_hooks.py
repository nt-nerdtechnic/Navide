"""Install Qwen Code hooks that report when a pane is waiting on the user.

Qwen Code inherits Claude Code's hook design wholesale — same settings.json
shape (`hooks.<EventName>[].hooks[].command`), same `type: "command"` runner,
same stdin-JSON contract — so the read/merge/write machinery is imported from
claude_hooks rather than duplicated. Only the settings location, the event set
and the endpoint segment differ.

We install ONE event: Notification. Qwen fires it with a `notification_type` of
`permission_prompt` (the turn is blocked on a tool approval), `idle_prompt`
(the turn ended and it wants the next instruction) or `auth_success`. That
field is what lets the frontend tell "parked on the user" apart from "done" —
the two are indistinguishable on the PTY, since a prompt box paints once and
then goes silent exactly like a finished turn.

Qwen's turn boundaries are deliberately NOT taken from hooks: its log reader
already synthesizes turn_complete from a silence window, and adding a Stop hook
would duplicate that signal for no gain.

No `matcher` is set, even though Qwen matches Notification hooks against the
notification type and `matcher: "permission_prompt"` would skip the curl on
every idle_prompt. The saving is a backgrounded, 2s-capped, `|| true` request
per turn; the risk is that a matcher semantic we have not verified silently
matches nothing at all, which fails closed and invisibly. The frontend filters
by type anyway.
