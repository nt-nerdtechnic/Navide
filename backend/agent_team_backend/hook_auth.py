"""What an installed CLI hook must present before ``/hooks/<vendor>`` believes it.

The hook commands live in the CLIs' own settings files, and those are world
readable — ``~/.claude/settings.json`` is 0644 under the default umask — so a
secret written into the command text (the way the rewake hook carries its
``t=``) is readable by every account on the machine, and the finding this
closes was exactly that: any local account could POST a forged ``stop`` or
``notification`` and have the frontend act on it.

This secret is not in the command. The command names a file, and curl reads
the header out of it when the hook fires (``-H @file``). The file is 0600 in
the app data directory: a hook running as this user presents it, another
account cannot open it, and nothing appears in ``ps`` because the value never
becomes an argument. Read at fire time rather than install time, so a pane
started before a backend restart keeps working with the command it was given
— the same reason the rewake token is persisted rather than minted per run.

Not a boundary against this user's own processes; nothing on this machine is.
