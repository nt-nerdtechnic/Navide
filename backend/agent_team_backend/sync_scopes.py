"""Scope adapters: how each Settings section presents itself to the sync engine.

An adapter answers two questions and nothing else — "what do you hold right
now" and "write this in" — so the engine stays ignorant of what a prompt or an
MCP server is, and a new section is a new adapter rather than a new branch
inside the engine.

**Sync is opt-in, per scope, per machine.** ``enabled_scopes`` starts empty:
nothing leaves a device until someone turns a section on. That is why the
default here is ``False`` rather than ``True`` — a sync feature that switched
itself on would upload a user's MCP secrets because they installed an update.

    here. An *imported* item arrived through a pull: its payload is kept
    sealed under the account key (the same associated data as on the wire),
    opened into memory on first use, and never written anywhere in the clear
    — not the vault, not a CLI's login file. ``imported_value`` is the one
    reader, for the spawn path.

    The ``sensitive`` flag asks the engine for what the rest of this design
    needs: no tombstone for an item that is merely not here, sealed conflict
    rows, and a failed round rather than a skipped record when a body will
    not open.

    Removal is local. A local item whose vault value is gone, or an imported
    one the user turned off here, is marked *disabled* — a secret-free row
    that survives restarts and re-enabling the scope, so a later pull cannot
    quietly put the credential back. A disabled item leaves the snapshot and,
    because of ``sensitive``, is not deleted from the cloud: other devices
    keep working, and this one is one explicit pull away from rejoining.
