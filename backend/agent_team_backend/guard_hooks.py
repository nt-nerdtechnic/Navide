"""Synchronous PreToolUse decisions for the CLIs that can be blocked by a hook.

Each vendor's installer writes a hook that POSTs the CLI's PreToolUse payload
to `/hooks/<vendor>/pretooluse` and prints the response body back to the CLI.
This module turns that payload into the neutral shape `guard.evaluate` takes
and turns its Decision into the answer the vendor reads.

Fail-open is decided here, not by the caller: anything going wrong (guard not
importable, evaluate raising or running past its budget) yields an empty
response, which every vendor below reads as "no decision" and falls back to
its own permission flow. That is the Phase 0 rule for LOCAL panes: a broken
guard must never wedge every CLI on the machine.

Verified vendor facts (official docs, read 2026-09-24):

claude — code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks. Payload: tool_name, tool_input
  (Bash → tool_input.command; Write/Edit/Read → tool_input.file_path),
  session_id, cwd, permission_mode. Output on exit 0: {"hookSpecificOutput":
  {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse", "permissionDecision": "allow|deny|ask|defer",
  "permissionDecisionReason": ...}}. Exit 2 blocks; any other exit does not.
  An `http` hook exists but its headers take only env-var interpolation (no
  file) and its URL is fixed at install time, so it could neither read the
  0600 hook secret nor follow the backend to a new port; the installed hook is
  therefore a command hook that reads both at fire time and prints our body.
  Measured on claude 2.1.281 (2026-09-24, `claude -p`, marker-file check):
  with --dangerously-skip-permissions a "deny" still blocked the command and
  an "ask" did not run it either (headless has no one to ask); interactive
  bypass + "ask" is not measured.

codex — learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks. Payload: tool_name "Bash" (command in
  tool_input.command) or "apply_patch" (patch text in tool_input.command), MCP
  tools as mcp__server__tool. Output: same hookSpecificOutput shape, but only
  "deny" and "allow" are honoured — "ask" is "parsed but not supported yet".
  So an ask is sent to codex as deny, with a reason telling the user to run it
  themselves. Hooks are on by default (`[features] hooks = false` turns them
  off); injected per launch with `-c hooks.PreToolUse=...`, see
  codex_session_hooks.

copilot — docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/hooks-configuration. Payload:
  toolName, toolArgs (object, or a JSON string), cwd, sessionId. Output is
  FLAT: {"permissionDecision": "allow|deny|ask", "permissionDecisionReason"}.
  A timeout is ALWAYS fail-open ("a timed-out hook surfaces a warning and lets
  the tool call proceed") while a non-zero exit other than 2 DENIES — so the
  hook command must end in `exit 0` and this endpoint must answer well inside
  timeoutSec. Default timeoutSec is 30.

qwen — qwenlm.github.io/qwen-code-docs/en/users/features/hooks. Payload:
  tool_name, tool_input, permission_mode. Output: the claude shape with
  allow|deny|ask; "ask" falls back to deny in headless (--prompt) runs and
  background subagents. Exit 2 blocks. Timeout is seconds, default 60.
