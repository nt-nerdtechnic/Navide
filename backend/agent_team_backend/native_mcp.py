"""Read-only reflection of the MCP servers each CLI keeps in its own config.

Users arrive with MCP servers already configured where their CLIs look for
them (``~/.claude.json``, ``~/.codex/config.toml``, ...). Navide's own MCP
settings page used to show only the servers Navide itself connects to as a
client, so a user could not see -- let alone compare -- what their agents
actually load. This module lists those native servers so the page can be a
single entry point for every CLI's MCP.

Like ``native_skills``, it never writes: the module has no write path at all,
by construction. Every call is a fresh scan; nothing is cached on disk. The
CLIs keep owning their own files.

Three rules the scan keeps:

- **Read the user's file, never our own.** Navide delivers its ``/plan-mcp``
  endpoint to a pane through app-owned documents and per-pane shim homes, so
  a real home file never carries it. Any record that does point at
  ``/plan-mcp`` is one of ours and is dropped, not reported as the user's.
- **Secrets stay behind.** Native configs hold API keys in ``env``, in
  ``headers``, inside ``args`` and inside URLs -- both as ``user:pass@`` and
  as a query parameter. Names and hosts cross the boundary so an entry stays
  recognisable; credential-shaped values do not.
- **A broken file is still reported.** A config that will not parse produces
  one invalid record naming the reason, because "nothing here" and "I could
  not read it" are different answers.

Scope is the user-global config of each CLI. Project-scoped MCP (claude's
``.mcp.json``, cursor's ``<workspace>/.cursor/mcp.json``) is deliberately out:
it belongs to a workspace, not to the machine, and the page this feeds is a
user-scope page.
