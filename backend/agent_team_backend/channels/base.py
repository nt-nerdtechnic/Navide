"""Shared types for chat-channel adapters (Telegram, Discord, Slack, ...).

Every adapter implements ``ChannelAdapter``. The manager owns the pipeline
(gate, pairing, bindings, delivery); an adapter only speaks its platform's
wire protocol and turns platform events into ``InboundMessage`` values.

Adapters own their receive loop: ``start()`` spawns an asyncio task and
returns, never blocking the event loop.
