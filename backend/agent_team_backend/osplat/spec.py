"""The contracts a platform implementation has to satisfy.

Named `osplat`, not `platform`, because `platform` is a stdlib module and a
package by that name inside the backend would shadow it for every importer.

Each Protocol here is a seam that already existed as a `sys.platform` branch
somewhere in the backend. Moving the branch here is the whole point: a feature
module asks the seam for a capability and never asks which OS it is running
on, so adding a platform means adding one implementation file rather than
finding every branch that needs a third arm.

A capability an implementation cannot provide reports `available() is False`
rather than raising or guessing. Callers already tolerate that shape — it is
how `proc_rusage` behaved on every non-Darwin platform — so a partial port
degrades to "this panel shows nothing" instead of taking down the request.
