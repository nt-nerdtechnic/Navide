"""The one place in the backend that asks which operating system this is.

Every other module imports a capability from here and uses it unconditionally.
That is the rule this package exists to make enforceable: `test_osplat.py`
asserts that no feature module outside `osplat/` branches on `sys.platform`,
so a new platform branch has to be written as an implementation rather than as
an `if` in the middle of a feature.

Selection happens once, at import. The alternative — resolving per call — buys
nothing (the answer cannot change while the process runs) and costs a branch
on paths that sample on a timer.
