"""CPU time of the CLI processes Navide runs.

`ps -o %cpu` is the obvious source and the wrong one: on macOS that column is
the process's *lifetime* average, so a CLI that has been resident for an hour
and is right now pinning a core still reads close to zero. `top -l 2` reports
the live figure but bakes in a one-second sample interval and caps the pids it
will take, which makes it unusable for a panel that has to open instantly.

What is both cheap and correct is the accumulated CPU time the kernel has
charged the process. Two readings divided by the wall time between them give
the average utilisation over that interval — which is what a resource panel
actually wants to show. This module only takes the readings; the differencing
lives in the caller, so that two windows sampling at different rates each get
their own interval instead of fighting over one shared previous sample.

On macOS the counter is read straight from the kernel through `proc_pid_rusage`
(see `proc_rusage`) — a syscall per pid, no subprocess to spawn or time out,
and the same figure `ps -o time=` prints once converted out of mach time units.
Everywhere else `ps` takes the whole pid list in one call.
