"""Cross-workspace inter-CLI messaging registry.

Renderer windows mirror their local pane handles here. The backend is the only
process that sees every workspace at once, so it owns target resolution for
`to: <folder>/<pane>` addresses. Delivery itself stays in the frontend
(injectPane), so the idle gate, per-pair rate limit, queue cap and message log
all keep working exactly as before.

Name uniqueness is per workspace — the same handle may exist in two different
workspaces, and a bare `to: <name>` still resolves only within the sender's own
workspace, which is today's behaviour unchanged.

Addresses carry an optional third dimension, the device: `to:
<device>/<workspace>/<pane>` names a pane on a specific machine. A UUID-shaped
leading segment is read as a device id here; anything else is only reconsidered
as a device *after* local resolution has failed, against the remote roster
(`parse_remote_target`), so no address that resolves on this machine today can
be re-pointed at another one.

    Called from the same register the owning window runs after it rebuilds a
    pane around a CLI that never stopped running, so the id that CLI was given

    Two rules keep an alias from meaning more than it should. A former id is
    refused when it is already tied to a *different* workspace — a pane may
    inherit its own past, never another project's. And a chain is flattened as
    it grows: reloading twice makes A→B and then B→C, so everything that
    pointed at B is repointed at C. One lookup always suffices, and forgetting
    B cannot strand A.

    What is *not* checked is whether the former id still names a live pane of
    somebody else's, and it cannot be: a detach registers the pane in the child
    window before the parent lets go of it, so at that moment the id is live,
    online, and owned by a different window — exactly what a mistaken claim
    would look like. The declaration is trusted because it comes from a Navide
    renderer, which is inside the trust boundary; a claim over a pane that is
    still online is logged so it is at least visible, and the one thing it must
    not be allowed to do — take a live pane's push channel away — is refused
    separately (push_delivery.adopt).

    One case is known to reach that warning without a hand-over behind it, and
    is left as a limitation rather than worked around here: a main window
    reloading while one of its run groups is detached restores that group's
    panes (`restoreWorkspacePanes` has no filter for it) before
    `getDetachedGroups` answers, so for a moment it claims the child window's
    ids. It cannot be fixed by ordering alone — the main process answers that
    query with an empty list until it knows the window's workspace — and the
    window drops those panes as soon as it is told, which retires the aliases
    with them.

    **Local addressing wins, always.** This is only ever consulted after the
    local resolver has already failed on the same string, which is what keeps a
    device name from silently stealing an address that works today: `two/proj/
    target` means the pane `target` in the workspace `two/proj` whether or not
    some machine in the team space is called `two`, because the workspace
    reading is tried first and, when it succeeds, this function is never called.
    The reverse order — device names first — would move a working address to
    another machine the moment a colleague named a laptop after a folder, and
    the sender would have no way to notice.

    So a name can only ever *add* reachability where the answer used to be an
    error. Three or more segments are required, matching the rule for id-shaped
    device segments: a two-segment `folder/pane` stays a workspace address.

    A label naming more than one device is refused rather than guessed —
    delivering an instruction to the wrong machine is not something the sender
    can undo after reading about it.
