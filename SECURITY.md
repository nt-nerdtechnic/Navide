# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Navide is currently pre-1.0. Security fixes target the latest code on `main` and the newest published release when releases are available.

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| Latest `0.1.x` release | Yes |
| Older snapshots | No guaranteed fixes |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public GitHub Issue for a suspected vulnerability.

Email **nt.nerdtechnic@gmail.com** with the subject:

```text
[Navide] Security Vulnerability
```

Include a description, reproduction steps, potential impact, affected versions or commits, and a suggested fix if available. Remove credentials, private source code, and unrelated personal data from the report.

The project aims to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide a status update within 7 days. These are response targets, not a guarantee of resolution within that period.

## Security model

Navide's Electron application, Python backend, PTYs, orchestration state, and workspace data run on the user's machine. The backend listens on loopback and is not designed to be exposed as a remote service.

Navide is local-first, not universally offline. External coding CLIs, cloud AI providers, Context7, search, Git hosts, MCP servers, and update checks can communicate with third parties when used. See [Privacy and Data Flows](docs/privacy.md).

### Credentials

- Coding-agent credentials remain in each external CLI's own configuration.
- Cloud AI keys entered in Navide are stored locally in the application data directory with restrictive file permissions (`0600` on supported systems).
- Exported settings redact API keys and tokens.
- Local file permissions are not protection against malware, a compromised account, unrestricted agents, backups, or another process running with equivalent authority.

### Agent authority

- Agents normally execute with the current user's operating-system permissions.
- Navide does not currently provide a complete workspace sandbox.
- YOLO mode may pass flags that bypass an external CLI's confirmations or sandbox. Some CLIs may execute tools without a confirmation gate even when Navide does not pass such a flag.
- Full Auto can answer agent questions without another user response.
- Use automation only in trusted, version-controlled workspaces and review resulting commands and diffs.

### Handoffs and logs

- Cross-agent and cross-stage handoffs can propagate task text, prior output, and accidental secrets.
- Complete secret scrubbing is not yet an enforceable security boundary.
- Run history, terminal logs, CLI logs, token metadata, Git history, and exported diagnostics may retain sensitive content.
- Never place credentials directly in prompts, plans, screenshots, issue reports, or files intended for handoff.

### External integrations

MCP servers and provider integrations execute according to their own configuration and trust model. Review commands, environment variables, endpoint URLs, and provider policies before enabling them.

## Known security limitations

- No complete cross-platform workspace sandbox
- No complete secret-redaction guarantee for handoffs and diagnostics
- External CLI permission semantics differ and may change between versions
- Locally persisted API keys are not stored in an operating-system secret vault
- Provider log readers depend on files or databases owned by external tools
- Automatic update security depends on signed, notarized release artifacts and GitHub Release metadata

The [Product Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) defines policy, isolation, and secret handling as a dedicated long-term horizon. Documentation must not claim those controls have shipped before they are implemented and verified.
