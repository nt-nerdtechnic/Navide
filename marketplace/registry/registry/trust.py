"""Capability + trust-tier policy (metadata/gate layer, NOT a sandbox).

A package's `manifest.requires` is its declared capability set. This module
turns publish-time facts into two pieces of trust metadata the Extensions view
can surface to warn users:

- **trust tier** -- `signed-verified` when a signature verified against the
  publisher's registered key at publish time; otherwise `unsigned`.
- **sensitive capabilities** -- `fs` and `terminal` grant filesystem and shell
  reach, so they warrant higher scrutiny; the rest (`git`, `search`, `chat`,
  `ui`) are standard.

This is deliberately simple and declarative. Actually sandboxing/enforcing the
capabilities at runtime is out of scope (that's a runtime executor).
